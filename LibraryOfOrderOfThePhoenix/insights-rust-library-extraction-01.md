### Library Description
**Brief Description**: A comprehensive Rust concurrency pattern validator that analyzes code for proper Send/Sync usage, detects potential deadlocks, and ensures safe concurrent programming
**Utility Domain**: Code Analysis & Safety Validation
**Market Need Justification**: Rust concurrency is notoriously complex and error-prone, with a PMF probability of 9/10 according to the analysis. Current tools like ThreadSanitizer work at runtime, but there's no comprehensive compile-time concurrency validator for Rust. With Rust adoption growing in systems programming and the complexity of async/await patterns, developers desperately need static analysis tools that prevent concurrency bugs before they reach production.
**LLM Prompt**: Create a Rust library that performs comprehensive static analysis of Rust code for concurrency safety. The library should validate Send/Sync trait usage, detect potential deadlocks through lock ordering analysis, validate atomic operations for proper memory ordering, ensure correct lifetime management in concurrent contexts, and analyze async/await patterns for race conditions. Focus on compile-time analysis that integrates with cargo check and provides actionable error messages with suggested fixes.

**Brief Description**: A Rust-native distributed coordination and shard management system for search clusters, providing automatic failover, load balancing, and cluster state management with zero-downtime operations.

**Utility Domain**: Distributed Systems & Cluster Management

**Market Need Justification**: The OpenSearch document extensively details the complexity of distributed shard management, noting that "each shard is a fully independent, self-contained Lucene index" and emphasizing the critical role of cluster manager nodes in "managing the overall cluster state, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding where to allocate shards." Current Java-based solutions suffer from GC pauses during critical coordination operations. A Rust implementation would provide predictable latency, memory-safe cluster state management, and superior performance for high-frequency shard operations.

**LLM Implementation Prompt**: Build a distributed cluster coordination system in Rust for search engines. Implement: 1) Raft consensus protocol for cluster state management using async-raft crate, 2) Automatic shard allocation and rebalancing algorithms with configurable policies, 3) Health monitoring and failure detection using heartbeat protocols, 4) Zero-downtime cluster operations with rolling updates and graceful degradation, 5) Metrics collection and observability with prometheus integration, 6) Plugin system for custom allocation strategies, 7) REST API for cluster management operations, 8) Comprehensive testing with network partitions and Byzantine failure scenarios.

**Brief Description**: A Rust library for dynamic index mapping management, schema evolution, and field type optimization with automatic performance tuning and conflict resolution for search engines.

**Utility Domain**: Data Schema Management & Search Optimization

**Market Need Justification**: The document emphasizes that "the structure and data types of the fields within the documents of an index are defined by a mapping" and warns that "an unoptimized mapping can lead to wasted storage, slower query performance, and unexpected search results." Current solutions require manual mapping management and lack intelligent optimization. The document notes that "while OpenSearch can dynamically generate mappings based on the first document it sees, this is often inefficient."

**LLM Implementation Prompt**: Develop a sophisticated index mapping management system in Rust. Features: 1) Dynamic schema inference from JSON documents with statistical analysis of field patterns, 2) Automatic field type optimization based on query patterns and data distribution, 3) Schema evolution with backward compatibility and migration strategies, 4) Conflict resolution for mapping updates with rollback capabilities, 5) Performance analysis and recommendations for mapping improvements, 6) Integration with popular serialization formats (serde, JSON Schema, Avro), 7) CLI tool for mapping analysis and optimization, 8) Comprehensive validation with property-based testing for schema transformations.
