## Chunk Processing Methodology

### Chunk Configuration
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 lines per analytical unit
- **Overlap Size**: 300 lines between consecutive chunks
- **Context Preservation**: Overlap ensures narrative continuity
- **Progress Tracking**: Each chunk logged with source mapping

### Processing Pattern Example
```
File: example.txt (3000 lines)
Chunk 1: Lines 1-1000
Chunk 2: Lines 701-1700 (300-line overlap with Chunk 1)
Chunk 3: Lines 1401-2400 (300-line overlap with Chunk 2)  
Chunk 4: Lines 2101-3000 (300-line overlap with Chunk 3)
```

## Progress Validation Checkpoints

### After Each Session
- [ ] Run tree-with-wc.sh to validate catalog growth
- [ ] Update master catalog with new entries
- [ ] Verify uniqueness validation performed
- [ ] Document chunk boundaries and overlaps
- [ ] Create git commit with session details

### Phase Completion Milestones
- [ ] Phase 1: 30 chunks processed (15% progress)
- [ ] Phase 2: 75 chunks processed (40% progress)
- [ ] Phase 3: 110 chunks processed (60% progress)
- [ ] Consolidation: All unique opportunities validated (80% progress)
- [ ] Final validation: Catalog ready for strategic use (100% progress)

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Per-Chunk Validation
- [ ] Superintelligence framework consistently applied
- [ ] All 5 expert personas activated and contributed
- [ ] Skeptical Engineer challenges documented
- [ ] Conceptual blending produced innovative approaches
- [ ] Verification questions comprehensively answered
- [ ] Source traceability maintained

### Cross-Chunk Validation
- [ ] 300-line overlaps captured boundary insights
- [ ] Narrative continuity maintained across chunks
- [ ] Similar concepts properly consolidated
- [ ] No duplicate library entries created
- [ ] Progress tracking accurately reflects coverage
