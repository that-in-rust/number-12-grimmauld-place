The Ascendancy of Rust: An Industry Analysis of Corporate Adoption and the Talent Ecosystem

Executive Summary: The Governing Argument

The global adoption of the Rust programming language is undergoing a
strategic and rapid expansion, driven by its unique capacity to deliver
both enterprise-grade security and disruptive performance. This dual
appeal has established Rust as a foundational technology for modernizing
legacy systems in public corporations and as a critical competitive
advantage for innovative private companies, cementing its role as a
definitive language for the next generation of critical software. An
exhaustive analysis of companies across the globe reveals a clear
pattern: Rust is being integrated into the core systems of a diverse
array of industries, chosen for its unparalleled guarantees of memory
safety, which eliminate entire classes of common security
vulnerabilities, combined with its high performance, reliability, and
advanced concurrency features.¹

This adoption is propelled by two distinct, yet complementary, strategic
imperatives. For large, publicly traded corporations such as Microsoft,
Google, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rust represents a powerful tool
for fortification—a way to systematically de-risk critical
infrastructure, modernize legacy C/C++ systems, and eliminate historical
sources of security vulnerabilities at a massive scale.¹ In contrast,
for privately funded companies and agile startups like Discord, Figma,
and Vercel, Rust is a tool of

disruption—a competitive differentiator used to build products with
superior performance, achieve greater resource efficiency, and attract
elite engineering talent with a modern, high-performance language.¹

This bifurcation in adoption drivers has created a powerful,
self-reinforcing cycle of growth and maturation for the entire Rust
ecosystem. The investment by public companies provides corporate backing
and de-risks the language for broader enterprise use, creating a stable
foundation upon which private companies innovate. These startups, in
turn, push the boundaries of the ecosystem, creating new,
high-performance libraries that are often open-sourced, enriching the
ecosystem for all users.¹

The resulting high-demand, high-skill job market is centered on systems
programming, cloud infrastructure, and decentralized technologies, where
Rust is becoming the new standard. The talent landscape is characterized
by a significant demand for senior engineers who possess not only deep
Rust proficiency but also extensive experience in adjacent systems
languages like C++ and Go. This report provides a definitive analysis of
Rust's corporate adoption across key global industries, dissects the
anatomy of the Rust talent market, and offers a forward-looking
perspective on the strategic implications for technology leaders and the
future of high-performance software development.

The Dual Engines of Rust Adoption: Fortification and Disruption

The accelerating adoption of Rust is propelled by two distinct, yet
complementary, strategic imperatives. For large, publicly traded
corporations, Rust represents a powerful tool for fortification—a way to
systematically de-risk critical infrastructure, modernize legacy C/C++
systems, and eliminate historical sources of security vulnerabilities at
a massive scale. In contrast, for privately funded companies and agile
startups, Rust is a tool of disruption—a competitive differentiator used
to build products with superior performance, achieve greater resource
efficiency, and attract elite engineering talent with a modern,
high-performance language. This bifurcation in adoption drivers
highlights the language's versatility and is fundamental to
understanding its strategic importance in the current technology
landscape.¹

Public Corporations: The Pursuit of Stability, Security, and Scale

Tech giants are strategically deploying Rust not merely for new
projects, but as a primary weapon in the ongoing battle to secure and
stabilize their most critical, large-scale infrastructure. This is not
an experimental endeavor but a calculated response to the persistent and
costly problem of memory safety vulnerabilities in systems-level code.¹
These investments are explicitly justified by security metrics and the
need for robust isolation in multi-tenant environments. A single major
security breach in these platforms can lead to billions in direct costs,
regulatory fines, and a significant drop in stock price. The decision to
adopt Rust is therefore not just a technical choice made by engineering
teams; it is a strategic, board-level risk management decision. It is a
direct investment in protecting shareholder value by systematically
eliminating a known, persistent, and costly class of vulnerabilities
that have plagued their C/C++ codebases for decades. This
"fortification" strategy by tech giants sends a powerful signal to the
rest of the market: for mission-critical infrastructure, the long-term
cost of

not using a memory-safe language like Rust is now perceived as greater
than the cost of adoption and training. This de-risks Rust for other
large, risk-averse enterprises and validates it as the new standard for
high-stakes systems programming.

Case Study: Microsoft's War on Memory Bugs

Microsoft's initiative to rewrite core components of the Windows kernel
and Azure services in Rust is a direct and strategic response to a
massive historical vulnerability vector. This decision is grounded in
hard data from the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), which
found that approximately 70% of its assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) were related to memory safety issues—a class of bugs
that Rust's compiler is designed to prevent at compile time.1 By
adopting Rust, Microsoft aims to eliminate entire categories of
memory-related flaws that have plagued system software for decades,
representing a fundamental shift toward building more secure and
reliable products from the ground up.1 This move provides a powerful
economic and security justification for a strategic technological shift.
The discovery of the first Rust-based kernel flaw in August 2025
provides a nuanced perspective; while Rust eliminates entire bug classes
like buffer overflows, implementation and logic flaws remain a
challenge, reinforcing the need for robust security practices even with
safer languages.1

Case Study: Google's Proactive Hardening of Android & Chrome

In a similar vein, Google is deeply integrating Rust into the Android
operating system as a core part of its security strategy. In the Android
13 release alone, 1.5 million lines of new native code for critical
components like Keystore2, the Ultra-wideband (UWB) stack, and the
Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) were written in Rust.1 The
motivation is singular: to reduce the platform's attack surface by
eliminating memory safety vulnerabilities, which have historically been
the leading cause of security issues in Android.1 The results have been
stark and offer definitive proof of concept for Rust's value
proposition. As of the Android 13 release, there have been zero memory
safety vulnerabilities discovered in the new Rust code.1 This success
has led to continued investment, with numerous job openings at Google
for Rust engineers working on security-critical components in Android,
ChromeOS, and Fuchsia OS.5

Case Study: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Secure Multi-tenancy

AWS's use of Rust in foundational services like Firecracker and
Bottlerocket is central to its serverless and container offerings,
including AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate. Firecracker, a lightweight
virtualization technology, can launch microVMs in as little as 125
milliseconds while consuming only about 5 MiB of memory, enabling
thousands to run on a single host and handling trillions of requests
monthly for AWS Lambda.1 Rust's compile-time guarantees of memory and
thread safety provide the strong isolation and minimal attack surface
necessary for a secure multi-tenant cloud environment—a non-negotiable
requirement for a public cloud provider of AWS's scale.1 Rust is also
used in components of Amazon S3, EC2, and CloudFront, demonstrating its
broad applicability across AWS's core infrastructure.1

Private Companies: The Quest for Performance and Competitive Edge

While public corporations use Rust for defense, privately funded
companies and startups are using it for offense. For these
organizations, Rust's extreme performance is not just an operational
efficiency but a core product feature and a key to disrupting
established markets.¹

Case Study: Discord's Elimination of Latency Spikes

The well-documented migration of Discord's 'Read States' service from Go
to Rust was driven by the need for predictable, low-latency performance,
a critical feature for a real-time communication platform. The Go
garbage collector was causing intermittent latency spikes that degraded
the user experience. By switching to Rust, which has no garbage
collector, Discord completely eliminated these spikes, achieving average
response times in microseconds and gaining a direct competitive
advantage in performance and reliability.1 This allowed them to scale to
over 11 million concurrent users with consistent performance.1

Case Study: Figma's Real-Time Collaboration Engine

The collaborative design platform Figma rewrote its high-performance,
real-time multiplayer syncing engine in Rust. This core component, which
powers the collaborative editing of all Figma documents, was originally
written in TypeScript. However, as the user base scaled, the team
encountered performance bottlenecks and issues related to the JavaScript
garbage collector. The rewrite to Rust delivered superior performance
and low resource usage, enabling the seamless, real-time experience that
defines their product and supports a massive user base.1

Case Study: Vercel's Developer Tooling Revolution

Vercel, the company behind the popular Next.js framework, is using Rust
to build a new generation of high-performance developer tooling.
Projects like Turbopack (an incremental bundler) and Turborepo (a build
system migrated from Go) demonstrate a strategy of using Rust's
performance to create a superior developer experience.1 Turbopack,
positioned as the successor to Webpack, shows updates 700x faster,
dramatically improving developer productivity and build times.1

The adoption patterns in public and private sectors are not isolated;
they create a mutually beneficial feedback loop. The investment by
public companies like AWS, Google, and Microsoft, who are founding
members of the Rust Foundation, provides corporate backing, funds core
development, and de-risks the language for broader enterprise use.¹ This
creates a stable foundation upon which private companies can innovate.
These startups and private firms, in turn, push the boundaries of the
ecosystem, creating new, high-performance libraries in domains like AI
and databases. These libraries are often open-sourced, enriching the
ecosystem for all users, including the large enterprises that provided
the initial stability. This symbiotic relationship accelerates the
maturity of the entire ecosystem far faster than if either sector were
acting alone. Furthermore, for startups, choosing a modern,
highly-regarded language like Rust serves as a strategic tool for
attracting elite engineers who are motivated by challenging technical
problems and cutting-edge technologies, providing a crucial advantage in
the competitive market for talent.¹

Sector-by-Sector Analysis: Where Rust is Mission-Critical

Rust's adoption is not uniform; it is concentrated in sectors where its
core value propositions of performance, safety, and concurrency provide
a decisive advantage. This section provides a detailed map of this
adoption landscape, demonstrating how Rust is becoming the language of
choice for a new generation of mission-critical systems across diverse
industries.

Re-Plumbing the Internet: Cloud, Networking, and Core Infrastructure

Rust's most mature and impactful domain of adoption is in the
foundational software that powers the internet and cloud services. An
analysis of leading technology, security, and observability companies
reveals a clear trend: Rust is becoming the default choice for new,
high-throughput, and security-critical infrastructure. Its combination
of C++-level performance with compile-time memory safety guarantees
allows engineers to build systems that are both exceptionally fast and
fundamentally more secure, addressing the core challenges of
internet-scale services.¹

A significant indicator of Rust's maturity is its use in replacing
decades-old, battle-tested infrastructure written in C and C++. The most
prominent example is Cloudflare's Pingora, an in-house HTTP proxy
framework built entirely in Rust to replace their long-standing NGINX
infrastructure.¹ The results of this migration are profound: Pingora
handles over one trillion requests per day while requiring only a third
of the CPU and memory resources of the previous NGINX-based system.¹
This is not merely a technical achievement but a significant economic
one, translating directly into millions of dollars in operational
savings at Cloudflare's scale.¹ The recent discovery and rapid
mitigation of a request smuggling vulnerability (CVE-2025-4366) in the
open-source version of Pingora also serves as a case study in the
maturity of the Rust security ecosystem, demonstrating a robust process
of community-driven discovery, responsible disclosure, and swift
resolution.¹

The performance and efficiency of Rust are particularly critical for
data-intensive observability and security platforms. Datadog maintains
and uses Vector, a high-performance, open-source data pipeline built
entirely in Rust, which is benchmarked as being up to 10 times faster
than alternative solutions.¹ Datadog has also leveraged Rust to rebuild
its AWS Lambda Extension, reducing cold start times by 82% and memory
consumption by 40%, and to rewrite its static analyzer, achieving a 3x
performance increase.¹ Similarly,

Sentry's critical edge ingestion service, Relay, is built in Rust to
handle hundreds of thousands of events per second globally, showcasing
how Rust's concurrency features can be used to build robust, highly
scalable data ingestion pipelines.¹

Rust, particularly when combined with its mature WebAssembly compilation
target, is enabling a new architectural pattern: the "single secure
core." This model involves writing the most sensitive logic—such as
cryptography and business rules—once in Rust and then deploying that
same compiled library natively on all target platforms. 1Password is the
quintessential example, having rebuilt its entire application logic
around a single 'Core' component written in Rust that now powers every
client.¹ This architecture drastically reduces development overhead and
eliminates entire classes of bugs and security vulnerabilities that
arise from inconsistencies between platform-specific implementations.¹

The Performance Backbone: AI, Machine Learning, and Data Platforms

Rust's influence is rapidly expanding into the performance-critical
layers of the AI, machine learning, and data science ecosystems. While
Python remains the dominant language for high-level research,
experimentation, and orchestration, Rust is becoming the essential
language for the underlying infrastructure that demands maximum
performance, memory efficiency, and concurrency. This emerging
architectural pattern, a symbiotic Python/Rust duality, leverages the
strengths of both languages to build the next generation of data and AI
platforms.¹

Leading AI platforms and research organizations are relying on Rust to
build their core, speed-sensitive components. OpenAI uses Rust for its
performance-critical tooling, including tiktoken, a high-speed Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for its language models that is reported to be
3 to 6 times faster than comparable open-source tokenizers.¹ Faster
tokenization directly translates to faster data preparation, which in
turn accelerates training and inference pipelines.

Hugging Face, the central hub of the open-source AI community, has built
its foundational libraries in Rust to provide the performance backbone
for its platform. This includes its widely used tokenizers library,
which can process a gigabyte of text in under 20 seconds, the
safetensors format for secure and fast model sharing, and the candle
minimalist ML framework.¹

A growing number of data-intensive companies have undertaken full
rewrites of their core platforms in Rust. InfluxData re-engineered its
next-generation time-series database, InfluxDB 3.0, moving from Go to
Rust and building on top of Apache Arrow and DataFusion.¹ This strategic
decision yielded dramatic results: up to 45x better write throughput and
5-25x faster queries compared to the previous version, allowing InfluxDB
to solve the long-standing industry problem of handling high-cardinality
data efficiently.¹

Deepgram migrated its entire AI speech recognition platform from Python
and Go to Rust, resulting in a 30-80% gain in speed, lower latencies,
and enhanced request concurrency.¹

This pattern reveals a powerful architectural trend: a Python front-end
for ease of use and rapid experimentation, coupled with a Rust core for
raw computational performance. This is not a competition between
languages but a symbiotic relationship where Rust handles the heavy
lifting, which is then exposed to the vast Python ecosystem via robust
bindings.¹

The Language of Trust: Safety-Critical and High-Integrity Domains

Beyond raw performance, Rust's most defining feature is its set of
compile-time guarantees against common memory errors. This focus on
safety and correctness is making Rust an indispensable tool in
industries where software failure can have catastrophic consequences.
From the complex electronic systems in modern vehicles to the secure
handling of financial assets, Rust is emerging as the language of trust
for building the next generation of safety-critical and high-integrity
systems.¹

In the automotive and aerospace industries, as vehicles and spacecraft
become more autonomous and connected, the complexity and criticality of
their software are increasing exponentially. Renault Group, through its
EV and software company Ampere, has officially adopted a
"Rust-by-default" strategy for its next generation of Software-Defined
Vehicles (SDV), viewing the language as a way to address new
cybersecurity concerns.¹

Volvo Cars has also officially confirmed that Rust code has been running
in production vehicles (EX90 and Polestar 3 models) since October 2024,
specifically for Electronic Control Units (ECUs) responsible for
low-power management.¹ In aerospace,

Firefly Aerospace has publicly detailed rewriting its entire flight
control stack in Rust, a move that resulted in zero crash reports during
operation.¹

Rust's ability to produce small, efficient binaries with no garbage
collector makes it an ideal choice for embedded systems and IoT devices.
Espressif Systems, a major manufacturer of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
microcontrollers, provides extensive and official support for Rust on
its hardware, making it a first-class citizen for embedded development
on its popular chips.¹ In consumer robotics,

Matic Robots has built approximately 95% of its autonomous floor
cleaning robot's intelligence codebase in Rust, including critical
on-device processing for real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping).¹

In the high-stakes world of financial services and cryptocurrency, the
integrity and security of software are non-negotiable. Kraken, a major
cryptocurrency exchange, uses Rust extensively to modernize its core
backend services, including distributed data storage and cryptography.¹

Hyperswitch, an open-source financial switch built entirely in Rust, is
PCI DSS 3.2.1 Level 1 certified, the highest level of security
certification for handling cardholder data, demonstrating Rust's
suitability for building systems that meet the most stringent financial
security standards.¹

From Milliseconds to Market Share: Consumer-Facing Applications

In consumer-facing industries like e-commerce, media, and gaming,
performance is not just a technical metric—it is a core product feature
that directly impacts user experience, engagement, and ultimately,
market share. Companies in these sectors are adopting Rust to gain a
competitive edge by building faster, more responsive, and more reliable
applications.¹

For e-commerce and logistics platforms, handling massive traffic spikes
is critical. Shopify leverages Rust for its most performance-critical
systems, most notably in YJIT, a new Just-In-Time compiler for Ruby.¹
YJIT delivered an average of 14.1% faster latency on Shopify's core
Storefront Renderer, a crucial improvement for a platform that handles
over 80 million requests per minute during peak events.¹

Deliveroo, a major online food delivery company, migrated its critical
Tier 1 Dispatcher service from Ruby to Rust, which saw dispatch
processing time drop from approximately 4 seconds to just 0.8 seconds in
one large zone, directly impacting the efficiency of their delivery
network.¹

In media and gaming, where real-time interaction is paramount, Rust's
lack of a garbage collector provides a decisive advantage. Brave, the
company behind the privacy-focused web browser, wrote its core
ad-blocking engine, adblock-rust, entirely in Rust.¹ This resulted in a
transformative 69x average performance improvement, reducing the time to
classify network requests to just 5.7 microseconds and lowering CPU
usage on user devices.¹

In productivity tools, where responsiveness is key, and in healthtech,
where correctness is vital, Rust provides a powerful combination of
speed and safety. Dropbox uses Rust in multiple performance-critical
areas. Its core file synchronization engine, 'Nucleus', was rewritten in
Rust to improve correctness, and a custom Rust library for the Dropbox
Capture product enabled higher-quality screen recording (up to 4K) and a
smaller application footprint.¹ In healthtech,

CancerIQ strategically rewrote its complex cancer risk prediction models
in Rust to leverage its strong guarantees of memory safety and robust
error handling for critical calculations where correctness is of the
utmost importance.¹

The Anatomy of a Rust Developer: Core Competencies and Adjacent Skills

A structured breakdown of hundreds of job descriptions reveals that
proficiency in Rust alone is insufficient. The most valuable candidates
are T-shaped professionals who combine deep Rust expertise with broad
systems engineering knowledge and domain-specific skills.³³

-   Core Rust Proficiency (Non-Negotiable): A deep, practical
      understanding of Rust's unique and most challenging features is
      the absolute baseline. This includes not just syntax but a
      fundamental grasp of the ownership model, borrowing rules, and
      lifetimes. Mastery of Rust's approach to memory management
      (without a garbage collector) and its "fearless concurrency" model
      (async/await, multithreading, Send/Sync traits) is essential.
      Finally, idiomatic use of Rust's robust error handling mechanisms
      (Result and Option) is a key differentiator.³³

-   Essential Adjacent Technologies: The most sought-after Rust
      developers are those who can apply their skills within a broader
      technological context. Experience with other systems languages,
      particularly C++ and Go, is frequently listed as a preferred or
      required qualification. This is because many roles involve
      migrating legacy systems or integrating Rust into polyglot
      environments. Proficiency with cloud-native technologies,
      especially Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes, is a near-universal
      requirement for backend and infrastructure roles. Experience with
      cloud platforms, predominantly AWS, is also critical.³⁵

-   Domain-Specific Expertise: For roles in the hiring hotbeds,
      domain-specific knowledge is crucial. In Web3, this means
      experience with blockchain protocols (e.g., Solana, Ethereum),
      smart contract development, and cryptography. For embedded
      systems, it involves experience with real-time operating systems
      (RTOS), hardware communication protocols (SPI, I2C), and
      microcontroller architecture (e.g., ARM Cortex-M).²⁵

-   Soft Skills and Behavioral Competencies: Given the complexity of the
      problems Rust is used to solve, job descriptions consistently
      emphasize non-technical skills. Excellent problem-solving, strong
      communication, and effective teamwork are paramount. A
      demonstrated passion for technology and a commitment to continuous
      learning are also frequently cited, reflecting the need for
      developers who can keep pace with a rapidly evolving ecosystem.³⁵

Career Progression and Compensation Analysis

The path to becoming a professional Rust developer is distinct from that
of many other languages, with a heavy emphasis on prior systems
experience. This dynamic has profound implications for career
progression and compensation.

Analysis of job postings reveals that "entry-level" Rust positions are
exceedingly rare.³⁸ The vast majority of roles are for "Senior,"
"Staff," or "Principal" engineers, almost always requiring 5+ years of
general systems programming experience in a language like C++ or Go, in
addition to 2+ years of professional Rust experience.³⁹ This creates a
significant barrier to entry, as there is no clear, well-trodden path
for a new graduate to become a professional Rust developer directly. The
market expectation is that they will first gain several years of
experience in another systems language.

This experience paradox is a direct result of Rust's primary use case:
building complex, mission-critical systems where errors are
exceptionally costly. Companies deploying Rust for core cloud
infrastructure, blockchain protocols, or automotive safety systems
cannot afford to have junior developers learning the fundamentals on the
job. They need engineers who already possess a deep, intuitive
understanding of systems programming concepts—memory management,
concurrency, networking, and hardware interaction—and can then apply
that experience within Rust's safety-focused paradigm.

This dynamic directly fuels the talent shortage and the resulting salary
premium. With high demand for experienced systems programmers and a
limited supply of those who have also mastered Rust, compensation is
highly competitive. Analysis of salary data confirms that Rust
developers command a significant salary premium, estimated at 15-20%
over comparable roles in other languages.⁷ The average salary for a Rust
developer in the United States is approximately $171,000 per year, with
top earners at major tech hubs and in high-demand sectors like Web3 and
AI commanding salaries well over $200,000.²⁸ The job market continues to
expand rapidly, with an estimated 35% year-over-year increase in job
postings for Rust skills.⁷

The most successful companies will be those that recognize this
experience paradox and adapt their hiring and training strategies
accordingly. Rather than searching exclusively for the small pool of
developers with many years of professional Rust experience, a more
effective strategy is to identify and hire strong systems engineers from
C++ and Go backgrounds and invest heavily in structured internal
training, mentorship, and pair programming to transition them to Rust.
As the market analysis shows, many companies are now willing to hire
promising developers with less Rust experience and invest in their
training.⁷ This is not just a benefit for employees; it is a strategic
necessity to build a sustainable talent pipeline in a market where
"entry-level" is a misnomer.

Strategic Implications and Future Outlook

The rapid adoption of Rust and the unique characteristics of its talent
market present both opportunities and challenges for technology leaders.
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions
about technology roadmaps, talent acquisition, and long-term strategy.

Navigating the Talent Chasm: The Learning Curve and Hiring Strategy

A primary strategic challenge for organizations adopting Rust is
navigating its steep learning curve and the resulting talent shortage.⁴¹
For developers, particularly those coming from garbage-collected
languages like Python or Java, Rust's ownership, borrowing, and lifetime
concepts require a fundamental mental model shift.⁴² This is not a
language that can be mastered in a weekend; proficiency typically takes
months of dedicated effort.⁷

This learning curve, combined with high demand, has created a
significant talent shortage, making the hiring of experienced Rust
developers a highly competitive and expensive endeavor.⁴¹ As established
in the previous section, the market heavily favors senior engineers with
prior systems programming experience, creating an "experience paradox"
that limits the pool of available talent.

To overcome this, organizations must adopt a proactive and strategic
approach to talent acquisition and development. The most effective
strategy involves prioritizing the hiring of strong systems engineers
with backgrounds in C++ or Go and then investing in a structured
internal program to upskill them in Rust. This program should include
dedicated training time, access to expert resources (either internal
mentors or external consultants), and a culture that encourages pair
programming and collaborative learning. When hiring externally,
organizations should look for candidates who, while they may lack
extensive professional Rust experience, demonstrate passion and
initiative through a portfolio of personal or open-source Rust
projects.³⁵

Enterprise Readiness and Ecosystem Maturity

Despite the talent challenges, the Rust ecosystem has reached a level of
maturity that makes it a viable and compelling choice for enterprise
development. However, organizations must be clear-eyed about the
remaining hurdles. The cost of training, the technical complexity of
integrating Rust with large, existing C++ codebases, and the impact of
long compilation times on developer productivity are all significant
considerations that must be managed.⁴⁴

Fortunately, the ecosystem provides robust support to mitigate these
challenges. The standardized and widely praised tooling, particularly
the Cargo build system and package manager, streamlines dependency
management and provides a consistent development experience that is
often superior to the fragmented tooling in the C++ world.³³ The backing
of the Rust Foundation by major corporations like AWS, Google,
Microsoft, and Huawei provides financial stability and a clear signal of
long-term commitment to the language's development.¹ Finally, the
growing network of professional consulting firms de-risks adoption by
providing expert support for complex migrations and team training.¹

A major hurdle for adoption in companies with massive legacy codebases,
such as Google and Meta, is the friction of interoperability between
Rust and C++.⁴⁷ These companies cannot afford a full rewrite, so the
viability of Rust depends on how seamlessly it can be introduced into
existing projects. The development of tools like

cxx, which facilitates safe interoperability, is a direct response to
this critical need. The significant investment from companies like
Google and Meta in improving this interoperability is a leading
indicator of their long-term commitment.³ As Rust/C++ interop becomes
safer and more ergonomic, Rust will increasingly be seen not just as a

replacement for C++ but as a modernization path for it. New,
security-sensitive modules will be written in Rust and linked into
existing C++ applications, allowing for gradual, strategic modernization
without the prohibitive cost of a complete rewrite. This "incremental
safety" model will likely be the dominant adoption pattern in large
enterprises over the next decade.

Future Trajectory: From "C/C++/Rust" to the New Default

Looking forward, Rust is exceptionally well-positioned to become a
dominant force in systems programming for the next decade and beyond.
While a full displacement of the trillions of lines of existing C++ code
is unlikely, Rust is on a clear trajectory to become the default choice
for new systems programming projects where both performance and safety
are critical. It has successfully changed the conversation from "C/C++"
to "C/C++/Rust" and is poised to become the modern successor to C++ for
a new generation of software.⁴⁸

The language is fundamentally aligned with the defining technological
trends of the coming years: the continued expansion of distributed cloud
systems, the proliferation of AI and the need for high-performance
infrastructure to support it, and the ever-increasing importance of
software security. Its strong and unified community, robust corporate
backing, and a growing list of proven success stories in production at
the world's largest and most innovative technology companies have
created a powerful momentum that will be difficult to stop.⁷ For
technology leaders, the question is no longer

if they should consider Rust, but how and where they should
strategically deploy it to build the next generation of secure,
efficient, and reliable software.
