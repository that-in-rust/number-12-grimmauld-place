  "input": "Research Briefing & Objective:\n\nYou are a Senior Staff Engineer and technical author building a definitive visual knowledge base called \"The Architect's Playbook.\" Your mission is to curate a library of the most insightful and well-designed diagrams, images, and visual explanations related to software and distributed system design. This library will be used for training materials, technical documentation, and architectural whitepapers.\n\nPhase 1: Search & Selection Criteria\n\nYour goal is to find high-quality images that visually explain a core concept in system design. Each image must be:\n\nInformative: The diagram must clearly and accurately represent a specific architectural pattern, concept, or data flow (e.g., Load Balancer setups, Caching strategies, CAP Theorem trade-offs, Microservices communication patterns).\n\nWell-Annotated: The image should have clear labels, legends, and annotations that make it understandable even with minimal accompanying text.\n\nSourced: The image must originate from a reputable technical source, such as a well-known engineering blog, official cloud provider documentation (AWS, GCP, Azure), a conference presentation, or an academic paper.\n\nPhase 2: Dataset Compilation & Final Deliverable\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format, with each row representing a single, unique system design image.\n\nThe table must have the following exact headers:\n\nImage_URL (A direct link to the image file)\n\nConcept_Pattern\n\nDescription\n\nComplexityLevel\n\nSourceType\n\nSource_URL (The URL of the article or page where the image was found)\n\nConstraint Checklist:\nConcept_Pattern: This should be the primary concept the image illustrates. Use standardized terms like Rate Limiter, Circuit Breaker, Service Discovery, CQRS, Event Sourcing, CAP Theorem, Message Queue, Sharding, Leader Election, etc.\n\nDescription: Provide a 1-2 sentence summary of what the diagram is showing.\n\nComplexityLevel: Classify the concept's difficulty as Foundational, Intermediate, or Advanced.\n\nSourceType: Categorize the source as Engineering Blog, Official Documentation, Conference Talk, Academic Paper, or Book.\n\nExclusions: Avoid overly simplistic, low-resolution, or purely decorative images that do not add genuine educational value. Do not include screenshots of code.",
