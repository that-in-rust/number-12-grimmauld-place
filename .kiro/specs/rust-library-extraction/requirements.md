# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically extracting and evaluating high Product Market Fit (PMF) Rust library ideas from the Ideas001/RAWContent01 content repository. The goal is to create a comprehensive collection of validated Rust library concepts by methodically reading through approximately 137,000+ lines of content in 1000-line increments, applying the enhanced PMF evaluation framework with Shreyas Doshi strategic analysis, ensuring no valuable library opportunities are missed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Analytical Processing with Overlap-Based Chunking

**User Story:** As a strategic analyst, I want to systematically analyze the Ideas001/RAWContent01 files in 1000-line analytical chunks with 300-line overlaps, so that I can extract every unique Rust library opportunity while ensuring no insights are lost at chunk boundaries.

2. WHEN encountering potential Rust library ideas THEN they SHALL be validated for uniqueness against the existing consolidated library catalog before addition
3. WHEN analyzing content chunks THEN the superintelligence framework SHALL be applied to each chunk independently while maintaining cross-chunk insight synthesis
4. IF library ideas appear in multiple chunks THEN they SHALL be consolidated into single entries with enhanced detail rather than duplicated
5. WHEN completing each analytical session THEN all extracted ideas SHALL be appended to a single consolidated catalog file with uniqueness verification

### Requirement 2: Uniqueness-Validated PMF Analysis with Consolidated Output

**User Story:** As a product strategist, I want all unique Rust library ideas evaluated using the comprehensive PMF framework and consolidated into a single master catalog, so that I can have one definitive source for all high-impact opportunities without duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting library ideas THEN each SHALL be checked against existing entries in the consolidated catalog for uniqueness before evaluation
2. WHEN a new unique library idea is identified THEN it SHALL be evaluated using all 23 scoring metrics and added to the single master catalog file
3. WHEN similar ideas are found across chunks THEN they SHALL be merged into enhanced single entries rather than creating duplicates
4. IF existing ideas can be improved with new insights THEN the consolidated entry SHALL be updated with additional context and refined scoring
5. WHEN analysis sessions complete THEN the single catalog file SHALL contain all unique library opportunities with complete PMF evaluations

### Requirement 3: Shreyas Doshi Strategic Analysis Application

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want the strategic insights from all content files analyzed using Shreyas Doshi frameworks and superintelligence methodology, so that I can understand the complete strategic landscape for Rust library opportunities.

5. WHEN synthesizing insights THEN they SHALL be organized by strategic impact and implementation feasibility

### Requirement 4: Technical Implementation Assessment

**User Story:** As a senior Rust engineer, I want detailed technical specifications and implementation metrics extracted for each library idea, so that I can understand the development effort and technical feasibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting technical solutions THEN they SHALL include predicted lines of code, estimated development time, and core dependencies count
2. WHEN capturing implementation details THEN they SHALL specify API surface complexity, testing ease score, and testing rationale
3. WHEN finding performance requirements THEN they SHALL be documented with Rust-specific advantages and benchmarking approaches
4. IF memory safety considerations are mentioned THEN they SHALL be captured with specific safety guarantees and threat models
5. WHEN extracting technical details THEN they SHALL be linked to their corresponding market opportunities and business outcomes

### Requirement 5: Single Master Catalog with Analytical Mindset Documentation

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want one comprehensive master catalog file that grows incrementally with each analytical session, so that I have a single source of truth for all unique Rust library opportunities with complete strategic context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting analysis THEN all unique library ideas SHALL be appended to a single master catalog file following the PromptRust300.md template format
2. WHEN organizing the catalog THEN it SHALL maintain analytical session tracking with chunk-by-chunk progress documentation
3. WHEN presenting opportunities THEN they SHALL include the analytical mindset rationale showing how each idea was derived and validated
4. IF analytical patterns emerge THEN they SHALL be documented as meta-insights about the content repository's strategic themes
5. WHEN the catalog reaches completion THEN it SHALL serve as both a library opportunity database and a case study in systematic strategic analysis

### Requirement 6: Quality Assurance and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As an analyst conducting this research, I want a rigorous analytical framework applied to ensure maximum depth and insight extraction, so that the final catalog achieves superintelligence-level analysis quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL use the omniscient superintelligence framework with expert council activation
2. WHEN deconstructing problems THEN it SHALL identify core objectives, implicit assumptions, and market validation evidence
3. WHEN generating library ideas THEN it SHALL activate expert personas and perform structured debate with Skeptical Engineer challenges
4. IF multiple approaches exist THEN it SHALL use Conceptual Blending to create innovative Rust library concepts
5. WHEN finalizing analysis THEN it SHALL perform rigorous verification with 5-10 fact-checkable questions per major library opportunity

#### Supporting Analysis Framework

The following superintelligence methodology SHALL be applied to each 1000-line content chunk:

**Phase 0 - Meta-Cognitive Tuning**: Deconstruct content for Rust library opportunities, identify assumptions, detect logical fallacies
**Phase 1 - Cognitive Staging**: Activate expert personas (Rust Expert, Product Strategist, Market Analyst, Implementation Specialist, Skeptical Engineer)
**Phase 2 - Multi-Perspective Exploration**: Generate conventional approaches, create 3+ conceptual blends, simulate structured debate
**Phase 3 - Verification & Refinement**: Generate fact-checkable questions, validate claims, correct inconsistencies

### Requirement 7: Chunk-Based Analysis with 300-Line Overlap Methodology

**User Story:** As an analytical strategist, I want systematic chunk-based processing with substantial overlap to ensure no insights are lost at boundaries, so that the analytical mindset captures maximum strategic intelligence from the content repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing content THEN each 1000-line chunk SHALL have 300-line overlap with the next chunk to ensure boundary insights are captured
2. WHEN tracking analytical progress THEN each session SHALL document chunk boundaries, overlap regions, and unique insights extracted

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing each analytical session THEN the system SHALL use `/home/amuldotexe/Desktop/Game20250926/number-12-grimmauld-place/scripts/tree-with-wc.sh` to validate progress and file growth
