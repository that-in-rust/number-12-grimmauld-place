# Rust 300: High-Impact, Small-Scale Rust Library Opportunities

## Main Thesis
The Rust ecosystem has significant opportunities for small (<300 LOC), high-impact libraries that are `no_std` compatible, deterministic, SIMD-accelerated, and dependency-minimal. These libraries would fill critical gaps in mathematical functions, data structures, algorithms, and low-level primitives, with potential for WebAssembly compilation to extend their utility to web environments.

1. **Mathematical Special Functions**: Tiny, `no_std`-friendly implementations of functions like `erfcx`, incomplete gamma/beta, and `sinpi`/`cospi` that outperform existing solutions.
2. **Numerical Robustness Utilities**: Stable algorithms like compensated summation, log-sum-exp, and polynomial evaluation to prevent floating-point precision issues.
3. **Bit-Twiddling and Succinct Data Structures**: Micro-utilities for Morton encoding, broadword rank/select operations, and other bit manipulation techniques.

### Performance-Critical Operations
1. **SIMD-Accelerated Primitives**: High-performance kernels for string operations, data transformation, and byte manipulation leveraging CPU vector instructions.
2. **Integer Compression & Bitpacking**: Micro-kernels for efficient data encoding crucial for databases and time-series storage.
3. **Data Layout Transformations**: Optimized conversions between array-of-structures and structure-of-arrays for cache locality and SIMD processing.

### Domain-Specific Algorithms
1. **Linear Algebra & 3D Math**: Compact, deterministic kernels for matrix operations and quaternion math for graphics and games.
2. **Computational Geometry**: Robust primitives for geometric operations essential in GIS, games, and robotics.
3. **Time-Series/DSP Kernels**: Implementations of signal processing algorithms for audio analysis and anomaly detection.

### Infrastructure & Systems Programming
1. **Lock-Free & Wait-Free Primitives**: Minimalist concurrency primitives for high-throughput, low-latency operations.
2. **Checksums & Non-Cryptographic Hashes**: Hardware-accelerated implementations critical for storage and networking.
3. **Cryptographic & Constant-Time Micro-Primitives**: Small, auditable building blocks for secure library development.

### Data Management & Processing
1. **Minimal Perfect Hashing**: Efficient static hash implementations separating build-time generation from runtime lookup.
2. **RNG & Sampling Primitives**: Lightweight implementations of PRNGs and sampling algorithms for simulations and data analysis.
3. **Streaming Statistics**: Numerically stable, single-pass algorithms for variance, summation, and regression.
4. **Parsing & Formatting Micro-Libraries**: High-performance utilities for fast integer parsing and formatting.
