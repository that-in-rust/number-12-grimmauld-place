    "executive_summary": "Writing top-quality, idiomatic React code in 2025 involves a paradigm shift towards server-centric architectures while mastering a core set of foundational principles and modern patterns. The ecosystem, led by frameworks like Next.js (App Router) and Remix, has moved beyond client-side-only rendering, emphasizing React Server Components (RSC), server-side data fetching, and mutations via Server Actions. This approach enhances performance, reduces client-side JavaScript, and improves security by default. Key idiomatic methods include a strict adherence to the Rules of React—especially component purity and the rules of Hooks—and a disciplined approach to state management that clearly distinguishes between client state (managed with `useState`, `useReducer`, or libraries like Zustand) and server state (managed with framework data loaders or libraries like TanStack Query). Component composition, accessibility-first design using headless primitives, and robust testing strategies focused on user behavior (with React Testing Library) are non-negotiable. The modern developer must also avoid common pitfalls such as misusing `useEffect`, prop drilling, and directly mutating state. Ultimately, top-quality React code is achieved by leveraging the full capabilities of modern frameworks, writing clean, composable, and predictable components, and embedding performance, security, and accessibility into the development process from the outset.",
    "pareto_principle_justification": "The curated set of patterns and practices detailed in this report addresses the Pareto principle by equipping developers to handle approximately 95% of typical product development scenarios with a minimal, yet powerful, toolkit. Modern web applications are largely composed of a few core tasks: fetching and displaying data (Read), creating and updating data through forms (Create/Update), deleting data (Delete), routing between pages, and managing application state. This collection of idiomatic methods provides first-class solutions for each:\n\n1.  **CRUD UIs (Data Fetching & Mutations):** Modern frameworks like Next.js (with Server Components and Server Actions) and Remix (with Loaders and Actions) provide a complete, server-centric model for all CRUD operations. Mastering these framework-native patterns eliminates the need for complex client-side data fetching logic for the majority of use cases. This covers everything from displaying lists and detail pages to handling data submissions securely on the server.\n\n2.  **Forms:** Instead of building complex form logic from scratch, mastering a dedicated library like `react-hook-form` combined with a schema validation library like `Zod` covers nearly all form-related requirements. This includes state management, validation (client and server-side), error handling, and performance optimization for large forms.\n\n3.  **Routing and Layouts:** The file-system-based routing in Next.js and Remix, along with their support for nested layouts, covers all standard routing needs, from simple pages to complex, nested dashboards. Advanced patterns like Next.js's Parallel and Intercepting Routes handle even sophisticated UI patterns like deep-linkable modals.\n\n4.  **State Management:** The distinction between server state and client state is key. By using framework data fetching for server state and a combination of local state (`useState`), Context (for low-frequency global state), and a lightweight global store (like Zustand) for client state, developers can manage the full spectrum of state requirements without over-engineering.\n\nBy focusing on these high-leverage, framework-integrated patterns, a developer bypasses countless hours of building bespoke solutions and is empowered to efficiently build robust, performant, and maintainable features that constitute the vast majority of product work.",

They should not modify pre-existing objects or variables.",

When multiple components need to share and reflect the same changing data, that state should be 'lifted up' to their closest common ancestor component.",
        "justification": "This unidirectional data flow makes the application's state easier to understand, track, and debug. It avoids the chaos of two-way data binding and creates a clear, predictable structure. Lifting state up is the simplest and most idiomatic way to share state without introducing external libraries.",
        "related_anti_pattern": "Props Drilling: When state is lifted up too high or components are not composed correctly, props are passed down through many intermediate components that don't use them.

These two types of state have different characteristics and should be managed with different tools.",

The developer experience is designed to be minimal and intuitive, with an API that mirrors React's own `useState`. The core API consists of a single `atom` function to create primitive, derived, or asynchronous state atoms. This simplicity and flexibility allow developers to build up state management organically as the application grows, without significant upfront boilerplate.",

Components subscribe only to the specific atoms they read, not to a large, central store. This results in highly granular and optimized re-renders by default. When an atom's value changes, only the components that depend on that specific atom will re-render. This eliminates the common performance pitfall seen in Context, where all consumers re-render. Furthermore, derived atoms (selectors) are automatically memoized, meaning developers do not need to manually apply memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-computations.",

      "recommended_pattern": "Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is a highly recommended architectural methodology for scalable frontend applications. It organizes the codebase into a strict hierarchy of layers (`app`, `pages`, `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, `shared`), where each layer has a distinct responsibility and can only import from layers below it. Within these layers, code is further partitioned into 'slices' based on business domains (e.g., `user-profile`, `order-cart`). Each slice must expose a public API (via an `index.ts` file), enforcing encapsulation and preventing other parts of the app from depending on its internal implementation details.",
      "key_tooling": "Code quality automation is essential for enforcing architectural rules. Key tools include: ESLint with plugins like `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce module boundaries and prevent circular dependencies (`import/no-cycle`). TypeScript in strict mode is fundamental for type safety. Prettier ensures consistent code formatting. In a monorepo context where this pattern is often applied, tools like Turborepo or Nx are used for high-performance task running and caching, and their configurations can be used to enforce boundaries between packages.",
      "benefits": "The primary benefits of adopting a pattern like FSD are enhanced scalability and maintainability. The modular and layered structure makes it easier to manage large, complex codebases. It promotes controlled code reuse, preventing spaghetti code and tight coupling. The strict boundaries and public API for each slice make the application more stable, as changes within one feature are less likely to cause unintended side effects elsewhere. This standardization also accelerates the onboarding process for new developers, as the project structure is predictable and well-documented."

The most directly supportive passages state that Jotai employs an atomic model where state is composed of small, independent atoms, and that its core API is minimal (atom function) and enables derived or asynchronous atoms. These passages also explicitly contrast the bottom-up atomic approach with centralized stores, which aligns with the requested state-management pattern. Additional excerpts discuss Jotai's favorable performance due to granular reactivity (only components reading an atom re-render) and its SSR/RSC compatibility, including hydration utilities like useHydrateAtoms for server-to-client transitions. Taken together, these excerpts collectively substantiate the described state-management strategy and its ergonomics. Specific points include: - \"Jotai takes a bottom-up approach with an atomic state management model, where the global state is composed of many small, independent, and isolated pieces of state called 'atoms'.\" - \"The core API consists of a single atom function to create primitive, derived, or asynchronous state atoms.\" - \"Components subscribe only to the specific atoms they read, not to a large, central store, which yields excellent performance by default.\" - \"Jotai provides first-class SSR/RSC compatibility, with utilities like useHydrateAtoms to hydrate server-fetched atom values on the client.\" - \"Derived atoms (selectors) are automatically memoized, reducing manual memoization needs.\" - \"Jotai is ideal for developers who prefer a flexible, bottom-up, and highly performant state management solution that scales with SSR/RSC usage in frameworks like Next.js.\" These excerpts together directly support the field's stated value and context.

This technique is a core part of implementing accessible composite widgets like comboboxes or menus, and it is discussed in detail in the roving tabindex-focused items. Guidance on keyboard accessibility and ARIA roles for general keyboard navigation is provided by the ARIA/APG content, which outlines the keyboard interface expectations and patterns for accessible widgets. The \"Keyboard Interface\" APG entry directly describes the principles and methods for making keyboard interactions work for ARIA-enabled widgets, which underpins the field's requirement for keyboard operability and focus management. Additional entries discuss dialog/modals (Dialog Pattern) and combobox patterns, which are concrete overlay widgets where focus trapping and proper focus return are critical for accessibility. There are also excerpts showing practical patterns and testing approaches (e.g., aria attributes, data attributes, and the role of testing libraries like jest-axe) that reinforce how to verify these accessibility properties in practice. Taken together, these excerpts provide a coherent set of best practices for keyboard navigation, focus management, and ARIA guidance in interactive components, which aligns with the requested fine-grained field value. The order above prioritizes items with explicit focus-management techniques (roving tabindex and focus traps) and ARIA patterns for overlaid widgets, followed by general accessibility and specific widget patterns (dialog/combobox).",

            "`\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nCross-site scripting (or XSS) is a code vulnerability that occurs when an attacker “injects” a malicious script into an otherwise trusted website. The injected script gets downloaded and executed by the end user’s browser when the user interacts with the compromised website. This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy. Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability. Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags."

Additional excerpts that discuss DOMPurify and its role in preventing XSS reinforce this pattern and provide concrete usage examples, including sanitization calls and safe rendering outcomes. Other excerpts expand on broader security controls (Content Security Policy, Subresource Integrity) and on escaping/hardening practices, which support defense-in-depth but are secondary to the central DOMPurify-based mitigation described in the field value. Finally, excerpts that illustrate safe rendering practices (quoting the principle that raw HTML should not be inserted without sanitization) corroborate the core claim and provide complementary guidance.

Excerpts that directly enumerate anti-patterns and explain why they are harmful provide the strongest direct support. For example, listings such as the creation and propagation of props through multiple components (props drilling) explain how this causes tight coupling and brittle data flow, and they also discuss a remediation path (prefer context, or pass JSX to a child component to manage state). Similarly, guidance about using an index as a key explains the risk of incorrect state association and performance penalties, along with a recommended replacement of using stable IDs. Other clearly relevant entries discuss directly mutating state, misusing useEffect (deriving data or handling events in effects instead of render or event handlers), missing dependencies in hooks, premature memoization, and the anti-pattern of defining components inside render. Additional entries explicitly address other anti-patterns such as using dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization, or misusing the use client directive in Next.js, and testing implementation details, all of which align with the field's listed anti-patterns and remediation patterns. The included excerpts also provide concrete detection methods (ESLint rule mentions for no-array-index-key or exhaustive-deps, manual code review cues) and refactoring recipes (switch to stable IDs for keys, move data transformation to render time, move event handling into handlers, avoid creating components inside render, sanitize HTML before dangerouslySetInnerHTML, push interactive pieces to client components only when necessary). The presence of these explicit anti-pattern names, harms, detection cues, and refactoring guidance across multiple excerpts supports the field value as a cohesive catalog of anti-patterns with actionable remediation. The excerpts that discuss broader patterns or Next.js/Remix-specific patterns are supportive context but are less directly tied to the core anti-patterns in the field value; they reinforce the general ecosystem around React patterns and tooling (lint Rules, code review practices) and thus are placed lower in relevance, though still helpful for corroboration of best practices and tooling contexts.",

You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their ... ** [**Hooks**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) **let me do the same thing without an arbitrary division. This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

This maps directly to the field's definition and use-case statements, and to the notion of separation of concerns that underpins this pattern.\n- Compound Components: Excerpts discuss a parent component sharing implicit state with children via context, enabling a coordinated UI (e.g., tabs, accordions, dropdowns) with an expressive API. This aligns with the field's description of a shared-state, slot-like composition pattern.\n- Control Props: Excerpts cover the pattern where a component can be used in uncontrolled or controlled mode, with the consumer optionally passing value and onChange to externalize state management, illustrating the flexibility emphasized in the field value.\n- State Reducer: Excerpts introduce the concept of a reducer-like interception point for internal component state updates, enabling consumers to alter or block state transitions, which matches the field's 'state reducer' description and use-cases for edge-case customization.\n- Headless Components and asChild/Slot APIs: Excerpts explain headless components that provide logic and accessibility without markup, and the asChild/slot pattern (popularized by Radix) which merges control props and behavior onto consumer-provided markup for maximum customization. This exactly reflects the field's treatment of asChild-slot behavior and its role in design-systems.\nEach pattern is paired with explicit notes on usage scenarios and the benefits/tradeoffs, which strongly support the field value. The most relevant excerpts directly define patterns and give concrete examples, followed by excerpts that discuss evolution with hooks and context (which reinforces why these patterns persist and how they're implemented in modern React).

The Thinking in React steps outline how to break the UI into a component hierarchy, build static versions with props, identify minimal state, decide where to place state (lifting up), and enforce one-way data flow. The one-way data flow and lifting state up are further reinforced by the guidance that data flows from parents to children via props and that shared state should be lifted to a common ancestor. Additional excerpts discuss separating server state from client state, which aligns with a principled separation in state management for React apps. Collected quotes include the explicit rule about Hooks being top-level only, the emphasis that purity yields predictable rendering, and the Thinking in React five-step process, including breaking down UI into components, minimal state, and lifting state up.

This aligns with the field value's emphasis on an atomic state management model and a bottom-up approach contrasted with a single-store paradigm. In particular, the description that atoms exist as modular pieces and enable optimization based on their dependencies provides concrete support for the atomic, modular structure the field value highlights. The notion of a two-pronged principle—Primitive and Flexible—further reinforces the idea that the core API is simple (like useState) yet capable of building derived state and graphs of atoms, which matches the field value's claims about primitive, derived, or asynchronous atoms and the organic growth of state management as the app scales. The point that the API is minimalistic and aims for simplicity while enabling more than basic use cases corroborates the ergonomic and scalable design described in the field value. Additional passages noting that Jotai can build utilities atop its core API and that its API mirrors React's useState extend the support for a developer experience designed around simplicity and familiarity without boilerplate. Context about the origin and broader design goals (e.g., coming from a small team) provides supportive background but is less central than the explicit statements about bottom-up atomic composition, the primitive API, and the derived/graph capabilities.

Additional relevance comes from notes about identity considerations related to atoms, which can influence how updates propagate and potentially affect rendering efficiency. While some excerpts focus on API simplicity or design principles rather than performance, the lines emphasizing atomic subscriptions and per-atom updates are the most directly aligned with the stated performance characteristics. Context about the broader goals of simplicity or API design provides marginal support but is less central to performance mechanics. Taken together, the excerpts collectively support the idea that Jotai enables granular, efficient re-renders via its atomic model and per-atom subscriptions, with ancillary notes on architecture and memoization implications implied by the atomic approach.",

The excerpts also emphasize a minimalistic core API and the ability to compose atoms, which are structural traits that typically ease SSR integration and hydration in practice, aligning with the field value's claim of being a robust choice for SSR-enabled frameworks like Next.js. In particular, the emphasis on SSR considerations in the excerpt titles signals contextual relevance to server-side rendering and hydration workflows, while statements about a simple, flexible primitive API support ease of use and integration in SSR scenarios. The notes about atom referential identities and deriving atoms into a graph, while not SSR-specific, provide context for how the state model can behave in a hydrated, client-side environment, which complements understanding of hydration behavior. Finally, the claim that Jotai can do more than useContext or useState aligns with the field value's assertion of a robust, featureful toolset suitable for server/client boundaries, though it remains an auxiliary support to the explicit hydration mechanism described in the field value.",

The most directly relevant excerpt states that the App Router is a file-system based router that uses React's latest features, which directly supports the idea of a routing paradigm tied to the app/ folder structure. Excerpts describing the App Router in general and its guidance (Using App Router, App Router guides, and features available in /app) further corroborate that routing behavior and conventions are defined by the app directory layout and special route-related files.

Additional excerpts discuss related performance considerations, such as the prudent use of global state management and the importance of stable keys in lists; these provide contextual support by highlighting pitfalls that can counteract the benefits of memoization (e.g., overusing global state causing extra renders, or using index as a key causing unstable renders) and thus further reinforce why memoization patterns are essential.

The reasoning for relevance connects these points to the field value by highlighting: (a) the architectural shift toward server components and server actions to improve performance and security, (b) the idiomatic React rules and purity as foundation for reliable components, (c) the explicit separation of server and client state, and (d) robust testing and accessibility practices as essential to \"top-quality\" code in 2025.

Additionally, the concept of memoization is explicitly tied to the useMemo hook, reinforcing the idea that caching return values is a deliberate pattern. Relatedly, the notion that React.memo works by preventing re-renders when props (or their referential identity) are stable supports the emphasis on stable identities to avoid unnecessary renders. A parallel explanation notes that the main benefit of useCallback is to avoid writing a nested function, which ties into the broader theme of maintaining stable function references to preserve memoization effectiveness. Beyond these core ideas, broader performance guidance emphasizes mindful use of global state and selective rendering strategies to minimize renders, which complements the memoization narrative by framing it within overall render efficiency. Additionally, practical guidance about rendering lists underscores the importance of stable keys to help React identify changes efficiently, which is a concrete technique for maintaining stable identities in a dynamic UI. Finally, an anti-pattern is illustrated where using an index as a key can undermine identity stability unless certain conditions hold, highlighting the risks to memoization efficacy when identities are not stable.",

This aligns with a migration strategy that incrementally embraces concurrent rendering rather than forcing a wholesale rewrite. In addition, discussions around React 18's server-oriented capabilities and streaming render (renderToPipeableStream) illustrate how architecture shifts can be staged, with server-side rendering and Suspense enabling progressive loading. This supports a concrete pattern of gradual modernization rather than abrupt migration. StrictMode's dual-invocation of effects in development provides a safety net to surface improper cleanup and potential concurrency issues, which is critical when migrating to concurrent patterns and refactoring effects. The excerpts tied to StrictMode emphasize writing resilient effects and testing approaches to ensure correctness in a more concurrent, less deterministic execution environment. The excerpts relating to server components, Suspense, and streaming describe patterns for data fetching and rendering that align with modern RSC/Next.js approaches, reinforcing the migration path toward server-first rendering and incremental hydration. Finally, practical guidance around migration tooling, patterns, and test strategies (e.g., ESLint rules for Hooks, testing-library approaches) supports a safe, incremental modernization process.

The accompanying description of the algorithm for roving tabindex provides a concrete sequence for how focus should move and what state is updated as the user navigates. Further, guidance on using aria-activedescendant clarifies that only the container participates in the tab sequence while the active descendant within the container indicates which inner element has focus, which is essential for accessible keyboard navigation in widgets like menus, dialogs, and other composite controls. Visual focus indicators and ensuring the active element is scrolled into view reinforce the user-visible feedback necessary for keyboard users. The modal/dialog pattern notes the limitation that standard browsers do not permit moving focus outside a modal without closing it, which is a critical constraint for maintaining accessible focus management within that context.

            "`\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nCross-site scripting (or XSS) is a code vulnerability that occurs when an attacker “injects” a malicious script into an otherwise trusted website. The injected script gets downloaded and executed by the end user’s browser when the user interacts with the compromised website. This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy. Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability. Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags."

You can add this plugin to your project if you’d like to try it:\n\nThis plugin is included by default in [Create React App](/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) . ```\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n```\n\n```\n// Your ESLint configuration\n{\n  \"plugins\" : [\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks\"\n  ] ,\n  \"rules\" : {\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\" : \"error\" , // Checks rules of Hooks\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\" : \"warn\" // Checks effect dependencies\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**You can skip to the next page explaining how to write [your own Hooks](/docs/hooks-custom.html) now. ** On this page, we’ll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules. ## []() Explanation\n\nAs we [learned earlier](/docs/hooks-state.html) , we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:\n\n```\nfunction Form ( ) {\n  // 1. Use the name state variable\n  const [ name , setName ] = useState ( 'Mary' ) ;\n\n  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form\n  useEffect ( function persistForm ( ) {\n    localStorage . setItem ( 'formData' , name ) ;\n  } ) ;\n\n  // 3. Use the surname state variable\n  const [ surname , setSurname ] = us",
            "Hooks are JavaScript functions, but you need to follow two rules when using them. We provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically."

            "`\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nCross-site scripting (or XSS) is a code vulnerability that occurs when an attacker “injects” a malicious script into an otherwise trusted website. The injected script gets downloaded and executed by the end user’s browser when the user interacts with the compromised website. This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy. Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability. Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags."

The injected script gets downloaded and executed by the end user’s browser when the user interacts with the compromised website. This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy. Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability. Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags."

Additional excerpts acknowledge DOMPurify's role as an XSS mitigator and describe the general practice of using sanitization when rendering HTML, which corroborates the combined usage pattern of a sanitizer with a dangerouslySetInnerHTML workflow. Excerpts that discuss dangerous HTML rendering in React (dangerouslySetInnerHTML) further support the mechanism by which sanitization is critical, though they are stronger when paired with a specific library like DOMPurify. Taken together, the most supportive evidence points to a practice where DOMPurify is used to sanitize content prior to dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage, reducing XSS risk. The broader statements about escaping, CSP, and general XSS prevention provide contextual backing for why sanitization libraries are important, but are less directly about the stated combination and thus are considered supporting context rather than primary evidence.",

Additional excerpts describe practical use-cases in design systems and accessibility implications, supporting the field's use-cases and benefits.

Collectively, these excerpts map onto the field value's core components: client-side form state management with React Hook Form, validation with Zod, and ecosystem integration with Next.js Server Actions, as well as the potential for shared schemas across client and server for type safety.

Additionally, a separate excerpt explicitly enumerates the problem of using client components unnecessarily, which reinforces the same risk and aligns with the described harm. Supporting context from related anti-pattern discussions helps situate this concern within a broader pattern of tightly coupling components and misplacing business logic, which underscores why avoiding the directive in non-interactive components is advisable. An ancillary excerpt about escape hatches and related topics provides additional background on how developers sometimes bypass constraints, though it is less directly tied to the specific directive issue. Collectively, these excerpts corroborate the core idea that the unnecessary use of the client directive is a harmful pattern that should be avoided and refactored toward Server Components whenever possible.",

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

      "reasoning": "The most directly relevant content is a concise definition of a presentational component (data-display through props, no data mutation, UI-focused) and a container component (data and behavior provisioning, often stateful). These passages establish the core dichotomy that the fine-grained field value centers on, including how presentational components render data and how containers supply data and actions. Additional excerpts elaborate on the benefits of separating concerns, reusability across data sources, and testing advantages, which align with the stated benefits. Several excerpts further contextualize this pattern by describing how modern React (e.g., Hooks) enables you to achieve similar separation without rigid boilerplate, which matches the trade-off/evolution note in the field value. Supporting excerpts also discuss patterns that interact with or contrast this approach, such as how state reducers and control props offer alternative ways to manage state or expose control to parent components, providing a broader view of the landscape while still supporting the core Presentational/Container concept. In summary, the strongest support comes from explicit definitions and benefits, with additional corroboration from discussions of evolution and related patterns. Direct quotes from these excerpts reinforce: (a) what presentational components do and how they receive data, (b) what container components do and how they supply data/behavior, (c) the practical benefits and caveats, and (d) how hooks and modern patterns influence the pattern's usage and potential overkill when over-applied.",

Excerpts that directly cover anti-patterns in React and emphasize keeping UI concerns separated from business logic or component definitions support this. One excerpt explicitly enumerates a common anti-pattern category and highlights that data fetching or transformation within a render-like context leads to tightly coupled components, which aligns with the risk of defining components inside render and the resulting performance and maintenance problems. Other excerpts emphasize that components should focus on presenting UI rather than implementing business rules, which reinforces the recommended restructuring away from render-time definitions. Collectively, these excerpts provide clear alignment with the described harm, and they also discuss ESLint guidance and tooling that help prevent such patterns, which strengthens the justification for the field value. The strongest direct support comes from statements that illustrate the harm of putting logic or subcomponents inside render and the guidance to avoid it by top-level definitions and prop drilling/refactoring practices.

Related excerpts reinforce the broader idiomatic React practices that underpin purity: one-way data flow, breaking UI into a component hierarchy, and the emphasis on props-driven and state-driven interactions. Together, these excerpts establish that predictable, pure component behavior underpins reliable rendering and performance, and that mutating state directly is antithetical to this paradigm.

This directly supports the field value's description of the parent-child relationship, shared state, and expressive API provided by the pattern. \n\nA third excerpt mentions compound components in the context of a broader list of design patterns, acknowledging it as a recognized pattern among other patterns.

By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple `useState` and `useEffect` calls. (If you’re curious, we’ll explain this in depth [below]() .) ### []() Only Call Hooks from React Functions\n\n**Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. ** Instead, you can:\n\n* ✅ Call Hooks from React function components. * ✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we’ll learn about them [on the next page](/docs/hooks-custom.html) ).\nBy following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code. ## []() ESLint Plugin\n\nWe released an ESLint plugin called [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if you’d like to try it:\n\nThis plugin is included by default in [Create React App](/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) . ```\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n```\n\n```\n// Your ESLint configuration\n{\n  \"plugins\" : [\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks\"\n  ] ,\n  \"rules\" : {\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\" : \"error\" , // Checks rules of Hooks\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\" : \"warn\" // Checks effect dependencies\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**You can skip to the next page explaining how to write [your own Hooks](/docs/hooks-custom.html) now. ** On this page, we’ll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules. ## []() Explanation\n\nAs we [learned earlier](/docs/hooks-state.html) , we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:\n\n```\nfunction Form ( ) {\n  // 1.

These points establish the core practice recommended for writing reusable, idiomatic React code around custom hooks. Supporting context from other excerpts discusses the broader rules of hooks and idiomatic patterns, including purity and hooks usage at the top level, which reinforce the environment in which custom hooks should operate (i.e., consistent hook invocation order, reusability, and predictability). Additional excerpts compare useState and useRef to clarify when to store and rerender state versus ephemeral references, which helps reason about when a pattern belongs in a custom hook versus internal component state.

Excerpts that discuss purity of components and hooks support the broader goal of predictable, debuggable, and optimizable React code, which aligns with an idiomatic pattern around hook usage.

By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple `useState` and `useEffect` calls. (If you’re curious, we’ll explain this in depth [below]() .) ### []() Only Call Hooks from React Functions\n\n**Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. ** Instead, you can:\n\n* ✅ Call Hooks from React function components. * ✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we’ll learn about them [on the next page](/docs/hooks-custom.html) ).\nBy following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code. ## []() ESLint Plugin\n\nWe released an ESLint plugin called [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if you’d like to try it:\n\nThis plugin is included by default in [Create React App](/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) . ```\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n```\n\n```\n// Your ESLint configuration\n{\n  \"plugins\" : [\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks\"\n  ] ,\n  \"rules\" : {\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\" : \"error\" , // Checks rules of Hooks\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\" : \"warn\" // Checks effect dependencies\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**You can skip to the next page explaining how to write [your own Hooks](/docs/hooks-custom.html) now. ** On this page, we’ll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules. ## []() Explanation\n\nAs we [learned earlier](/docs/hooks-state.html) , we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:\n\n```\nfunction Form ( ) {\n  // 1. Use the name state variable\n  const [ name , setName ] = useState ( 'Mary' ) ;\n\n  // 2.

For example, one excerpt points out that data fetching and transformation are combined directly inside the effect, which tightly couples the component and makes reuse or testing harder. This directly supports the notion of misusing the effect by performing work that may not require an effect at all. Other excerpts mention including business logic inside a component because it seems small, which is the broader rationale behind misusing useEffect—placing logic where it should not reside, thereby increasing complexity within the UI layer. Additional excerpts discuss problems like components focusing on UI rather than business rules, and the negative outcome of having complicated logic in views; while not exclusively about useEffect, they reinforce the broader principle of avoiding embedding non-UI logic in components or effects, strengthening the case for the anti-pattern. Collectively, these excerpts support the idea that using useEffect to perform work that could be separated (or avoided altogether) is an anti-pattern, and that such practices lead to tight coupling and harder testing/maintenance.

The asChild composition approach is highlighted as a technique for flexible composition, aligning with the need for reusable building blocks whose behavior remains consistent across different UI implementations. Additional excerpts enumerate common React design patterns and patterns used in design systems (component composition, polymorphic components, HOCs, render props, etc.), illustrating the ecosystem of patterns that collectively form the foundation for modern, accessible, and customizable component libraries. By naming patterns like compound components, state reducers, prop getters, and controlled props, the excerpts collectively map out the toolkit for building design systems where the logic is stable and accessible but the visuals are fully customizable, which matches the finegrained field value about the foundational patterns for Radix Primitives, Headless UI, and React Aria-style libraries.",

The combination of a pattern that centralizes logic (headless components) and a UI layer that remains accessible by default (Headless UI) directly maps to the stated benefits: separation of concerns for customization and built-in accessibility.

It also notes that hooks have made this easier compared to older class-component approaches. The excerpts collectively illuminate this trade-off. Statements about control props enabling external state control support the need for external boilerplate, since the consumer must manage state and wire it through props. References to control props patterns and their prevalence reinforce that this is a deliberate design choice with associated boilerplate when adopting the controlled mode. Finally, the reference to a family of patterns (including controlled props) underscores that while the API can remain simple, effective use of these patterns often entails some boilerplate and thoughtful design, aligning with the described trade-off. The combined evidence points to the central tension: greater external control comes with increased initial setup, though modern hooks simplify the implementation relative to earlier approaches.",

A headless component pattern defines a component that handles logic/state while leaving rendering to the consumer, illustrating the flexibility gained at the cost of additional implementation work. Similarly, Headless UI presents fully unstyled components meant to be styled by the developer, underscoring the tradeoff between flexibility and the burden of styling and composition work. The asChild pattern and polymorphic component discussions further reinforce the idea that advanced composition patterns enable highly flexible APIs and composition strategies, but can introduce type-safety complexity and implementation intricacies, which also touches on the work upfront and maintenance costs. Other excerpts discuss design patterns that enable composition (compound components, prop getters, etc.), highlighting that there is a spectrum between flexible, customizable APIs and the convenience (and constraints) of prebuilt patterns. Collectively, these excerpts map onto the tradeoff: greater control and customization by supplying your own UI and composing behavior from primitives, versus leveraging pre-styled or library-provided components to reduce upfront work but constrain styling/behavior. The most directly relevant segments explicitly articulate unstyled or headless approaches and their role in design patterns, while the others illustrate related composition techniques that influence the same tradeoff dynamics.",

Additional context comes from a related anti-pattern discussion that highlights how bundling and data handling choices (such as placing data fetching or transformation logic in client paths) can create tightly coupled, less reusable components, which aligns with why unnecessary client components are harmful. The escape-hatch discussion is less directly about the specific harm but supports the broader theme of bypassing framework optimizations, which can contribute to poorer performance if misused.

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

This explicit emphasis on a reducer that operates on the incoming changes to determine what state should actually be set aligns precisely with the described advanced pattern of inversion of control over a component's state updates. Additional excerpts reinforce this concept by naming the pattern, showing concrete reducer implementations, and contrasting it with alternative patterns such as control props. For example, when a post names and demonstrates the \"state reducer\" pattern and shows a function that takes state and changes and returns a possibly altered set of changes, it directly supports the exact mechanism described: the consumer can modify, block, or approve the state transition before it happens. Related discussions further support and contextualize this approach by explaining how this pattern sits between uncontrolled and controlled components and how it reduces boilerplate while preserving flexibility, which is consistent with the idea of providing a reducer to influence updates instead of taking full control. Additional excerpts that discuss a broader set of patterns (such as the state reducer in contrast to control props, or mentions of related patterns like render props and inverted control) reinforce the concept by showing where this pattern sits in the landscape of React design patterns and why it is a useful, idiomatic approach. Overall, the combination of explicit definition, practical example, and contextual comparison collectively supports the field value's claim about an advanced reducer-based inversion-of-control mechanism for state updates.

A related excerpt about data fetching and transformation in useEffect underscores the risk of coupling client logic with component lifecycles, which reinforces the strategy of keeping data handling on the server side when possible and passing data to client components via props. Additional excerpts on general React anti-patterns provide supporting context about patterns to avoid, such as prop drilling and in-component data manipulation, which complements the rationale for clearer server-to-client data flow via props. A final excerpt on escape hatches offers peripheral context about lower-level APIs, illustrating the boundaries of where client-side interactions should occur, thus supporting the idea of minimizing client logic at higher levels. Collectively, these excerpts support the refinement strategy of defaulting to server components, pushing client directives down, and using prop-based data transfer to client components.",

The second excerpt concerns the use of the client directive and the impact of client-side rendering on perceived performance, which relates to the trade-offs between server-rendered and client-rendered content and helps illustrate common pitfalls when opting into client rendering, thus supporting SSR/RSC considerations in practice. The third set, describing common React anti-patterns, mentions data fetching and transformation within client-side lifecycle hooks, illustrating the risks of coupling data fetching logic to the client, which is relevant for understanding why SSR/RSC patterns (e.g., server-side data fetching, avoiding client-side bottlenecks) can improve code quality. The fourth excerpt on Escape Hatches discusses bypassing framework limitations and accessing lower-level APIs, which can be tangentially relevant to advanced SSR/RSC use cases but is less directly about SSR/RSC patterns themselves; it provides broader context about when developers might override standard SSR/RSC boundaries.

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

This collection of excerpts collectively reinforces the field value by identifying the pattern name and detailing its core idea (reducing state changes via a reducer-like approach, distinct from fully controlled props). Direct quotes indicate the pattern's purpose and usage, such as reducing boilerplate, providing a simple API, and handling state transitions through a reducer-like function. The surrounding context about related patterns (render props, Downshift usage, and general design pattern landscape) provides supportive background but does not undermine the central claim about State Reducer as the targeted field value.

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

Several excerpts reinforce these points with additional nuance: one emphasizes the separation as a design pattern (presentational vs container) and discusses stateful vs stateless tendencies; another contrasts the two by stating containers supply data/behavior and often wrap presentational components; others reiterate that presentational components display data and may be pure functions, while containers manage state and data.

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

Excerpts describing patterns like state reducers in conjunction with broader pattern families (compound components, controlled vs uncontrolled, and the role of reducers) provide strong alignment with the stated use case for highly complex, reusable components where customization of transitions is required. Additional mentions of control props versus state reducers illustrate practical approaches to externalizing state control, which complements the use-case of intercepting and customizing internal transitions. Contextual notes about related patterns (render props) supplement the landscape of state-management patterns but are somewhat less central to the core use-case compared to explicit state reducer discussions. Together, these excerpts collectively support the notion that state-reduction-based patterns enable advanced customization of internal state transitions for complex UI widgets, while offering parallel approaches (control props) that reinforce extensibility and reusability.",

Another relevant excerpt points to a common anti-pattern where data fetching and transformation occur within a useEffect, illustrating why one should scrutinize in-component logic and only opt into client-side behavior when truly required. A broader anti-pattern-focused excerpt on React practices provides context for recognizing patterns that should be avoided, supporting the overall approach of selective client usage based on necessity. Collectively, these excerpts substantiate a manual review workflow that scrutinizes the presence and justification of the 'use client' directive to ensure client-side hooks are warranted, rather than always enabling client components by default.",

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

The lifting of state to a common parent and the idea of components being driven by props illustrate the correct pattern: centralize or properly own and update state immutably, so changes are detectable and components render correctly. The guidance to break UI into a component hierarchy, decide where state should live, and follow one-way data flow further reinforces that state updates should be explicit and immutable rather than in-place mutations. While many excerpts outline general React design steps and data flow, they collectively support the broader principle that state should be updated via controlled, immutable patterns rather than direct mutation.

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

Taken together, these excerpts support the field value by (a) describing the propagation of props down the component tree, (b) identifying lifting state up as a common related pattern that can propagate props through multiple layers, and (c) illustrating the broader implications for design and refactoring when props drilling becomes problematic, with suggested remedies like component composition or Context usage.",

Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose.

I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail.

It also notes Dan Abramov's view that Hooks can achieve similar separation of concerns more directly. Evidence from the excerpts supports this: one excerpt explicitly states that Hooks let you do the same thing without an arbitrary division between presentational and container components, directly aligning with the claim that Hooks reduce the rigidity of the pattern. Another excerpt discusses a state-reducer pattern enabled by React Hooks, illustrating how hooks-based patterns can encapsulate state-related logic in a more flexible way while still enabling separation of concerns. Additional excerpts frame the classic presentational/container distinction and its benefits, establishing the context in which Hooks offer an alternative approach. Taken together, these excerpts support the idea that Hooks provide a less rigid, more component-focused mechanism to manage state and behavior, potentially obviating some traditional container-component boilerplate, while acknowledging that such patterns can be overkill for simple components and may introduce complexity otherwise.\n\nIn detail: - The claim that Hooks allow the same separation of concerns without a strict container/presentational split is directly supported by the excerpt stating \"Hooks let me do the same thing without an arbitrary division.\" - The discussion of a state reducer pattern with Hooks demonstrates a concrete pattern where hook-based state management achieves nuanced control over behavior, reinforcing the idea that Hooks enable alternatives to traditional containers while preserving separations of concerns. - Excerpts describing Presentational and Container components and their separation provide the foundational context that Hooks are providing a different mechanism to achieve similar goals. - An additional excerpt notes that presentational components are often stateless and focused on UI, which aligns with the notion that Hooks enable stateful logic to live where it's most appropriate (often inside the component itself) rather than in higher-level containers.",

The statement that UI should be built by breaking it into components and describing visual states for each component aligns with modular design and opposes large, all-encompassing components. Additionally, the concept of one-way data flow from a top-level component to child components reinforces the idea that data responsibilities should be distributed rather than centralized into a single God Component. The five-step process and the general workflow described for building a React UI further support incremental decomposition over monolithic constructs.

The discussion of lifting state up to a common parent to share state demonstrates moving data higher in the component tree to avoid duplicating state across siblings, a pattern that helps distinguish source data ownership (often server-provided) from local UI state. The emphasis on one-way data flow reinforces that data originates from top-level sources and flows downward, which aligns with keeping server state separate from ephemeral client state. The explanations of components being controlled (driven by props) versus uncontrolled (driven by internal state) highlight the distinction between external data sources and internal UI state, a practical mechanism for separating server/stateful data from client-only state. Supporting this, the guidance to break the UI into a component hierarchy and build from a static version to a dynamic one underscores a deliberate approach to manage where state resides as the UI evolves, which is compatible with separating server state from client state.

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

Excerpts that discuss lifting state to a common parent and passing it via props illustrate how state can be centralized and shared across components, which is a core aspect of managing server-like state vs local UI state in practice. The discussion of controlled versus uncontrolled components highlights when state lives in React (UI-centric) versus when it is driven by external data or user interactions, aligning with the distinction between server state and client state. The notion of one-way data flow and breaking UI into components, followed by identifying the minimal complete representation of UI state, underscores how developers separate concerns between data that comes from servers and ephemeral UI state in the browser. Together, these excerpts provide concrete patterns and language for implementing and reasoning about server-state versus client-state management in React. While none explicitly define the server-client dichotomy, the cited patterns directly support the core idea of using different tools and approaches for data sourced from servers versus in-browser UI state, which is the essence of the finegrained field value.",

The fifth step, adding inverse data flow by passing update callbacks down as props, is also present in the related content. The surrounding excerpts reinforce the same themes: one-way data flow from top-level components, props as the conduit for data, and the general thought process of decomposing UI with components and data flow in mind.

This aligns with the portion of the field value about listing all values from the component scope that are used inside the effect in the dependency array. While one excerpt discusses calling hooks at the top level and maintaining predictable behavior, and another emphasizes purity and idiomatic patterns, neither explicitly describes the AbortController cleanup pattern or canceling in an effect. Therefore, the strongest connection is to the idea that dependencies must be managed (as enforced by tooling), with a weaker connection to the exact cleanup/cancellation strategy described in the field value. The excerpts collectively support the general principle that effects should be managed with proper dependency tracking and tooling enforcement, but do not fully confirm the AbortController pattern or explicit cleanup semantics in the field value.",

Among the excerpts, the one that discusses compound components emphasizes sharing implicit state between components, which is a core mechanism by which shared state can be exposed to children. This excerpt also frames compound components as a pattern that enables a cohesive API through coordinated state management, which aligns with the idea of a centralized context-ish mechanism. The excerpt that talks about the compound component pattern being future-proof through reusable, modular design provides indirect relevance by reinforcing how such patterns balance reusability and maintenance, which can be affected by how state is shared (potentially via context). The excerpt mentioning other patterns (state reducers, prop getters, controlled props) is tangentially relevant because these patterns influence how state and interactions are organized across a component tree, and may interact with a Context-like mechanism, but this excerpt does not explicitly discuss performance implications or context-based re-renders. Taken together, these excerpts offer contextual support for the broader topic of shared-state patterns and their trade-offs, but do not provide explicit evidence about React Context API-driven re-renders or performance impacts, which limits strong confirmation of the fine-grained field value.",

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail.

The sources explain the core distinction: useState causes re-render when the state changes, while useRef does not, which underlines why reading ref.current during render can be problematic and should not influence rendering. They also reinforce idiomatic patterns: hooks should be used in a way that predictable renders are preserved, and state is preferred for values that affect rendering. Additional references reinforce the broader rules of hooks and idiomatic React usage, which collectively support avoiding patterns that concatenate render-time mutations to refs and instead favor state-driven rendering and top-level hook calls. In more concrete terms, the guidance that you should not perform certain hooks-related actions inside loops, conditions, or nested functions reinforces that hooks (including ref usage) must be used predictably to avoid render-order issues and unpredictable state. Taken together, the cited excerpts substantiate the recommended practice: avoid reading/writing ref.current during render; use state for values that influence rendering; follow the hooks rules to keep rendering behavior predictable.",

The most directly relevant content explicitly says not to call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions, and to always use Hooks at the top level of the function. This matches the exact requirement of placing hooks at the top level and avoiding conditional or early-return contexts. Additionally, references that note 'Only Call Hooks at the Top Level' and explain that hooks must be called in the same order to preserve state further reinforce the same rule in practical terms. A citation that emphasizes the two core rules—top-level calls and calls from React functions (rather than regular JavaScript functions)—supports the structured enforcement and practical usage of this pattern, which aligns with the finegrained field value. Related excerpts discuss broader idiomatic React patterns and motivations (e.g., purity, general patterns, and a comparison of useState and useRef). While informative, they are not as directly about the top-level rule as the first group, but they still corroborate the general emphasis on correct hook usage and constraints, providing additional context. Therefore, the content from the most direct statements constitutes the strongest support, with the other excerpts providing supportive or contextual backing.",

The most directly relevant content comes from a comprehensive discussion of hooks usage that includes explicit references to useState alongside general hook patterns, which provides foundational support for selecting useState for simple state management and hints toward more complex patterns without explicitReducer guidance. Further supporting evidence comes from comparisons of useState with useRef, which clarifies when state changes trigger re-renders (useState) versus when they do not (useRef), reinforcing the idea of using simple state for independent values and more nuanced state strategies when re-render behavior or coordination between handlers matters. Additional context about idiomatic patterns and purity in components reinforces why predictable, straightforward state management is preferred in idiomatic React code, aligning with a recommendation to start with useState for simple state and escalate to more sophisticated approaches when complexity grows. The remaining excerpts discuss broader rules of hooks and best practices (such as avoiding hooks inside loops and using hooks at the top level) and general idiomatic guidance, which provide supportive context but do not directly specify a reducer-based pattern. Overall, the strongest support is for using useState for simple state and recognizing the need for more advanced state management (like a reducer) as complexity increases, with partial support and contextual emphasis from the related discussions on hooks usage and idiomatic patterns. There is no explicit evidence in the excerpts for the exact reducer-based recommendation, so the claim about useReducer is only partially supported, while the useState guidance is well-supported by the material.

            "JS\n\nImplication on SSR\n==================\n\nEvery time you use a styled-component that component has to become a client component by using the directive `'use client'` . This takes away the benefit of server components, If you aren’t aware of, server components means that you could do an actual DB read or API fetch server side and suspend that component while rendering a loading state very fast to the user. This is very powerful aspect of NextJS as you can have multiple components in a page that start fetching data on the server side before the user even gets the entire HTML and while their browser reads, transpiles and renders the DOM, CSS, etc… You are already ahead in calling your APIs or DBs.\nSo… If you say I’m willing to not use server component or do workarounds to use them, then you can go ahead on using styled-components 😄. I personally really enjoyed doing CSS-in-JS, so, *in some projects,* I made the difficult decision of letting some performance in the table for a different CSS management. **Configure Next JS**",

      "reasoning": "The provided value describes 'Zero-Runtime CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Vanilla Extract)' as a styling strategy, detailing its paradigm, performance, SSR/RSC compatibility, and developer experience. The excerpts offer strong support for each of these aspects.Several excerpts explain the core paradigm of zero-runtime CSS, stating that it involves writing CSS in JavaScript or TypeScript but generating static CSS files at build time, eliminating runtime overhead. This is explicitly mentioned for Vanilla Extract, which is described as a package for writing zero-runtime CSS using TypeScript or JavaScript, generating static CSS files at build time. It's also noted that this approach is like 'CSS Modules-in-TypeScript' but with scoped CSS Variables. The concept of compile-time processing, where all work is done ahead of time, is highlighted as the core idea behind these libraries.The performance impact is consistently described as excellent. The lack of a runtime JavaScript library for parsing and injecting styles leads to smaller client-side bundles and faster Time To Interactive (TTI). This is contrasted with traditional CSS-in-JS libraries, which add to the JavaScript bundle size.The SSR/RSC compatibility is strongly supported. Zero-runtime CSS is presented as fully compatible and the recommended approach for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and React Server Components (RSC). This is because these strategies do not rely on client-side hooks or React Context, allowing them to be used seamlessly in server-exclusive components. It is explicitly stated that traditional runtime CSS-in-JS libraries are fundamentally incompatible with RSCs and require the 'use client' directive, which negates some of the benefits of RSCs.The developer experience is also well-covered. Tailwind CSS is noted for its rapid development through utility classes and its comprehensive design system. Vanilla Extract offers type-safe, co-located styles within TypeScript, which is beneficial for component-based architectures without the runtime performance cost. Both approaches support robust theming, often through CSS custom properties, enabling dynamic features like dark mode. Design tokens, which are central to theming and consistency, are discussed as a key aspect of these systems, with tools like Style Dictionary and Tokens Studio supporting their management and transformation across platforms.",

By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple `useState` and `useEffect` calls. (If you’re curious, we’ll explain this in depth [below]() .) ### []() Only Call Hooks from React Functions\n\n**Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. ** Instead, you can:\n\n* ✅ Call Hooks from React function components. * ✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we’ll learn about them [on the next page](/docs/hooks-custom.html) ).\nBy following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code. ## []() ESLint Plugin\n\nWe released an ESLint plugin called [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if you’d like to try it:\n\nThis plugin is included by default in [Create React App](/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) . ```\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n```\n\n```\n// Your ESLint configuration\n{\n  \"plugins\" : [\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks\"\n  ] ,\n  \"rules\" : {\n    // ...\n    \"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\" : \"error\" , // Checks rules of Hooks\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\" : \"warn\" // Checks effect dependencies\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**You can skip to the next page explaining how to write [your own Hooks](/docs/hooks-custom.html) now. ** On this page, we’ll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules. ## []() Explanation\n\nAs we [learned earlier](/docs/hooks-state.html) , we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:\n\n```\nfunction Form ( ) {\n  // 1. Use the name state variable\n  const [ name , setName ] = useState ( 'Mary' ) ;\n\n  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form\n  useEffect ( function persistForm ( ) {\n    localStorage . setItem ( 'formData' , name ) ;\n  } ) ;\n\n  // 3.

[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) and [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) are lightweight alternatives to Redux, that allow you to split the state into multiple atoms or stores. They are easier to use than Redux, but they are less popular and have less community support.",

It can also be slightly less code if you want to be quick and dirty. Otherwise, you should usually use controlled components. If it’s still not clear which type of component you should use for a particular situation, you might find [this article on controlled versus uncontrolled inputs](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/) to be helpful. ### []() Default Values\n\nIn the React rendering lifecycle, the `value` attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you often want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a `defaultValue` attribute instead of `value` . Changing the value of `defaultValue` attribute after a component has mounted will not cause any update"

This text is left intact for historical reasons but don’t take it too seriously. **\n\nThere’s a simple pattern I find immensely useful when writing React applications. If [you’ve been doing React for a while](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html) , you have probably already discovered it. [This article explains it well](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) , but I want to add a few more points. You’ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you **divide them into two categories. ** I call them _Container_ and _Presentational_ components\\* but I also heard _Fat_ and _Skinny_ , _Smart_ and _Dumb,_ _Stateful_ and _Pure_ , _Screens_ and _Components_ , etc. These all are not _exactly_ the same, but the core idea is similar. My **presentational** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things look_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own. * Often allow containment via _this.props.children_ . * Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as Flux actions or stores. * Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated. * Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. * Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).\n* Are written as [functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations. * Examples: _Page, Sidebar, Story, UserInfo, List._\n\nMy **container** components:\n\n* Are concerned with _how things work_ . * May contain both presentational and container components\\*\\* inside but usually don’t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles. * Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. * Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. * Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources. * Are usually generated using [higher order components](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) such as _connect()_ from React Redux, _createContainer()_ from Relay, or _Container.create()_ from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand. * Examples: _UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList._\n\nI put them in different folders to make this distinction clear. ## Benefits of This Approach\n\n* Better separation of concerns. You understand your app and your UI better by writing components this way. * Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different state sources, and turn those into separate container components that can be further reused.\n* Presentational components are essentially your app’s “palette”. You can put them on a single page and let the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app’s logic. You can run screenshot regression tests on that page. * This forces you to extract “layout components” such as _Sidebar, Page, ContextMenu_ and use _this.props.children_ instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components. Remember, **components don’t have to emit DOM. ** They only need to provide composition boundaries between UI concerns. Take advantage of that. ## When to Introduce Containers? I suggest you to start building your app with just presentational components first. Eventually you’ll realize that you are passing too many props down the intermediate components. When you notice that some components don’t use the props they receive but merely forward them down and you have to rewire all those intermediate components any time the children need more data, it’s a good time to introduce some container components. This way you can get the data and the behavior props to the leaf components without burdening the unrelated components in the middle of the tree. This is an ongoing process of refactoring so don’t try to get it right the first time. As you experiment with this pattern, you will develop an intuitive sense for when it’s time to extract some containers, just like you know when it’s time to extract a function.\nMy [free Redux Egghead series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) might help you with that too! ## Other Dichotomies\n\nIt’s important that you understand that the distinction between the presentational components and the containers is not a technical one. Rather, it is a distinction in their purpose. By contrast, here are a few related (but different!) technical distinctions:\n\n* **Stateful and Stateless. ** Some components use React _setState()_ method and some don’t. While container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless, this is not a hard rule. Presentational components can be stateful, and containers can be stateless too. * **Classes and Functions. ** [Since React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) , components can be declared both as classes and as functions. Functional components are simpler to define but they lack certain features currently available only to class components. Some of these restrictions may go away in the future but they exist today. Because functional components are easier to understand, I suggest you to use them unless you need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations, which are only available to the class components at this time. * **Pure and Impure. ** People say that a component is pure if it is guaranteed to return the same result given the same props and state.\nPure components can be defined both as classes and functions, and can be both stateful and stateless. Another important aspect of pure components is that they don’t rely on deep mutations in props or state, so their rendering performance can be optimized by a shallow comparison in their [_shouldComponentUpdate()_ hook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) . Currently only classes can define _shouldComponentUpdate()_ but that may change in the future. Both presentational components and containers can fall into either of those buckets. In my experience, presentational components tend to be stateless pure functions, and containers tend to be stateful pure classes. However this is not a rule but an observation, and I’ve seen the exact opposite cases that made sense in specific circumstances. Don’t take the presentational and container component separation as a dogma. Sometimes it doesn’t matter or it’s hard to draw the line. If you feel unsure about whether a specific component should be presentational or a container, it might be too early to decide. Don’t sweat it! ## Example\n\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) pretty much nails it.\n## Further Reading\n\n* [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)\n* [Mixins are Dead, Long Live Composition](/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750)\n* [Container Components](/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005)\n* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)\n* [Building the Facebook News Feed with Relay](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/19/building-the-facebook-news-feed-with-relay.html)\n\n## Footnotes\n\n> \\* In an earlier version of this article I called them “smart” and “dumb” components but this was overly harsh to the presentational components and, most importantly, didn’t really explain the difference in their purpose. I enjoy the new terms much better, and I hope that you do too! > \n> \\*\\* In an earlier version of this article I claimed that presentational components should only contain other presentational components. I no longer think this is the case. Whether a component is a presentational component or a container is its implementation detail. You should be able to replace a presentational component with a container without modifying any of the call sites. Therefore, both presentational and container components can contain other presentational or container components jus"

[Add translation](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translation-contributions)\n\nThis post is here for historical reasons. Please read [an updated version of\nthis blog post with React\nHooks](/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks) ! You may also be\ninterested in the more general concept of [\"Inversion of\nControl\"](/blog/inversion-of-control) . This last week, [@notruth](https://github.com/notruth) (new code contributor to\nthe [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/README.md#contributors) project), filed an issue: [\"closeOnSelection\" property (Multiple selection out of box)](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/issues/319) . All you really need to know about that issue is that the decisions made about\nhow downshift updates its state based on user interaction in certain scenarios\ndidn't agree with what @notruth wants for their implementation. 😖😖\n\n### [Why do we use UI libraries? ](#why-do-we-use-ui-libraries)\n\nWith UI libraries like downshift, you can offer two things:\n\n1. The way it works\n2. The way it looks\n\nUI libraries have to make decisions about these things to be useful at all. But\nthe fewer decisions you make, the more generically useful and flexible\n(lego-block-like) your library can be.\n ... \nIn the case of @notruth, they only\nwant to prevent `isOpen` from changing to `false` if the user selects\n(keydown/click) on an item. So they need to know what type of change is about to\nhappen. Luckily, we needed this distinction for `onStateChange` as well and\nalready had this mechanism in place! It's called [`stateChangeTypes`](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statechangetypes) ( [here's the current list](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/118a87234a9331e716142acfb95eb411cc4f8015/src/downshift.js#L103-L119) ). 🤖🤖\n\nSo, @notruth opened [the pull request](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/pull/320) to add\nthe `modifyStateChange` . After considering it a little further, I decided that\nthis could be generalized into a pattern that could be really useful for other\nlibraries. Patterns are much easier to evangelize when they have a name, so [I looked for one](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/958707800292470784) . 🕵🕵️\n\n### [Introducing the state reducer pattern](#introducing-the-state-reducerpattern)\n\nI eventually settled on the name **\"state reducer\"** and changed the API\nslightly to resemble a reducer function. Your function gets two arguments: 1)\nthe current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to \"reduce\"\nthat to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want\nyour logic to apply.\nYou might think of the `changes` as an \"action\" in redux\n(it has a `type` ), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in\nredux), just the changes you want made to the state. 🔁🔁\n\n_A few people have since let me know that_ [`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) _has something\nsimilar to this called simply \"reducer\" which is validating because I think\nReason is pretty neat. 💡💡_\n\nSo, without further ado, [here is a very simple \"state reducer\" implementation with downshift](https://codesandbox.io/s/zy92xrwr3) that prevents the menu from closing after the user selects an item. Here's the `stateReducer` prop:\n\n```\nimport Downshift from ' downshift '\n\nfunction stateReducer ( state , changes ) {\n\tswitch ( changes . type ) {\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . keyDownEnter :\n\t\tcase Downshift . stateChangeTypes . clickItem :\n\t\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\t... changes ,\n\t\t\t\tisOpen: state . isOpen ,\n\t\t\t\thighlightedIndex: state . highlightedIndex ,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\tdefault :\n\t\t\treturn changes\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is a fairly loose API, but because all the state in downshift is\ncontrollable anyway (via control props) this doesn't actually allow you to do\nanything you weren't already able to accomplish yourself, it just reduces (no\npun intended 😆😆) the boilerplate and wiring that are necessary to tweak \"the way\nit works\" with regard to downshift and its state.\n👌👌\n\nThe implementation in downshift is probably not altogether straightforward I'm\nafraid (downshift is not a simple component). Which is why I've created this\nsimplified example implementation for [a toggle component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-build-a-toggle-component?af=5236ad) : [https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x](https://codesandbox.io/s/4qo58nvl3x?module=%2Fafter.js&moduleview=1) . Note that it's a little bit overkill for a toggle component, but hopefully it\ngets the point across of one way you could implement this pattern. 🤝🤝\n\n### [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nI'm really excited by this new pattern that I see sits in the sweet spot between\nan uncontrolled and an controlled component. I think it'll do a better job\nallowing our libraries to satisfy more use cases for \"the way it works\" without\nall the boilerplate and wiring up required by users of [the Control Props pattern](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-make-controlled-react-components-with-control-props?af=5236ad) . (And yes, I'll eventually be updating [my egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/advanced-react) to include a lesson on the\nreducer pattern). Good luck! 👍👍\n\nReact course\n\n!

            "Tabs Pattern",
            "Tabs are a set of layered sections of content, known as tab panels, that display one panel of content at a time. Each tab panel has an associated tab element, that when activated, displays the panel. The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel, most commonly the top edge. Terms used to describe this design pattern include:\n\nTabs or Tabbed Interface\n:   A set of tab elements and their associated tab panels. Tab List\n:   A set of tab elements contained in a [tablist](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) element.\n[tab](https://w3c.github.io/aria/)\n:   An element in the tab list that serves as a label for one of the tab panels and can be activated to display that panel. [tabpanel](https://w3c.github.io/aria/)\n:   The element that contains the content associated with a tab. When a tabbed interface is initialized, one tab panel is displayed and its associated tab is styled to indicate that it is active. When the user activates one of the other tab elements, the previously displayed tab panel is hidden, the tab panel associated with the activated tab becomes visible, and the tab is considered \"active\". ! [](../../../../content-images/wai-aria-practices/images/pattern-tabs.svg)\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n* [Tabs With Automatic Activation](examples/tabs-automatic/): A tabs widget where tabs are automatically activated and their panel is displayed when they receive focus. * [Tabs With Manual Activation](examples/tabs-manual/): A tabs widget where users activate a tab and display its panel by pressing `Space` or `Enter`. Keyboard Interaction\n--------------------\n\nFor the tab list:\n\n* `Tab`:\n  + When focus moves into the tab list, places focus on the active `tab` element. + When the tab list contains the focus, moves focus to the next element in the page tab sequence outside the tablist, which is the tabpanel unless the first element containing meaningful content inside the tabpanel is focusable.\n* When focus is on a tab element in a horizontal tab list:\n  + `Left Arrow`: moves focus to the previous tab. If focus is on the first tab, moves focus to the last tab. Optionally, activates the newly focused tab (See note below). + `Right Arrow`: Moves focus to the next tab. If focus is on the last tab element, moves focus to the first tab. Optionally, activates the newly focused tab (See note below). * When focus is on a tab in a tablist with either horizontal or vertical orientation:\n  + `Space or Enter`: Activates the tab if it was not activated automatically on focus. + `Home` (Optional): Moves focus to the first tab. Optionally, activates the newly focused tab (See note below). + `End` (Optional): Moves focus to the last tab. Optionally, activates the newly focused tab (See note below). + `Shift` + `F10`: If the tab has an associated popup menu, opens the menu. + `Delete` (Optional): If deletion is allowed, deletes (closes) the current tab element and its associated tab panel, sets focus on the tab following the tab that was closed, and optionally activates the newly focused tab. If there is not a tab that followed the tab that was deleted, e.g., the deleted tab was the right-most tab in a left-to-right horizontal tab list, sets focus on and optionally activates the tab that preceded the deleted tab.\nIf the application allows all tabs to be deleted, and the user deletes the last remaining tab in the tab list, the application moves focus to another element that provides a logical work flow. As an alternative to `Delete`, or in addition to supporting `Delete`, the delete function is available in a context menu. ### Note\n\n1. It is recommended that tabs activate automatically when they receive focus as long as their associated tab panels are displayed without noticeable latency. This typically requires tab panel content to be preloaded. Otherwise, automatic activation slows focus movement, which significantly hampers users' ability to navigate efficiently across the tab list. For additional guidance, see [Deciding When to Make Selection Automatically Follow Focus](../../practices/keyboard-interface/). 2. When a tab list has its [aria-orientation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) set to `vertical`:\n   1. `Down Arrow` performs as `Right Arrow` is described above. 2. `Up Arrow` performs as `Left Arrow` is described above. 3. If the tab list is horizontal, it does not listen for `Down Arrow` or `Up Arrow` so those keys can provide their normal browser scrolling functions even when focus is inside the tab list. 4. When the tabpanel does not contain any focusable elements or the first element with content is not focusable, the tabpanel should set `tabindex=\"0\"` to include it in the tab sequence of the page.\nWAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties\n--------------------------------------\n\n* The element that serves as the container for the set of tabs has role [tablist](https://w3c.github.io/aria/). * Each element that serves as a tab has role [tab](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) and is contained within the element with role `tablist`. * Each element that contains the content panel for a `tab` has role [tabpanel](https://w3c.github.io/aria/). * If the tab list has a visible label, the element with role `tablist` has [aria-labelledby](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) set to a value that refers to the labelling element. Otherwise, the `tablist` element has a label provided by [aria-label](https://w3c.github.io/aria/). * Each element with role `tab` has the property [aria-controls](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) referring to its associated `tabpanel` element. * The active `tab` element has the state [aria-selected](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) set to `true` and all other `tab` elements have it set to `false`. * Each element with role `tabpanel` has the property [aria-labelledby](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) referring to its associated `tab` element. * If a `tab` element has a popup menu, it has the property [aria-haspopup](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) set to either `menu` or `true`. * If the `tablist` element is vertically oriented, it has the property [aria-orientation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/) set to `vertical`.\nThe default value of `aria-orientation` for a `tablist` element is `horizontal`."

            "Nested Callbacks:\nAvoid deeply nested callback functions, as it can make the code harder to read and maintain. Consider breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions. \n// Anti-pattern  \nconst fetchDataApi = () => {  \n  fetchData().then((data) => {  \n    process(data).then((result) => {  \n      updateState(result);  \n    });  \n  });  \n}\nInstead, use separate functions or `async/await` for better readability:\n```\nconst fetchDataAndProcess = async () => {  \n  const data = await fetchData();  \n  const result = await process(data);  \n  updateState(result);  \n};\n",
            "Mutable State:\nModifying state directly can lead to unexpected behavior. Always use the `setState` function to update state, especially when the new state depends on the previous state.\n// Anti-pattern  \nconst [myObjcect, setMyObject] = useState({property: ''});  \n  \nconst handleClick = () => {  \n  // mutating state directly  \n  myObject.property = 'new value';  \n  setMyObject(myObject);  \n};\nUse the functional form of `setState` to ensure correct state updates:\n```\nconst [myObjcect, setMyObject] = useState({property: ''});  \n  \nconst handleClick = () => {  \n  setMyObject((prevObject) => ({  \n    ...prevObject,  \n    property: 'new value',  \n  }));  \n};\n",
            "Excessive Component State:\nAvoid unnecessary use of component state for every piece of data. Use state sparingly, and consider if a particular piece of data needs to be part of the component state or can be managed at a higher level (e.g., via context or Redux).\n"

            ")\n\nThe first question I would do is… Do you really want to use styled-components? At this point in 2024, I believe using styled components is a personal preference rather than a supported technical choice given the implications that using styled-components have when using on NextJS",
            "JS\n\nImplication on SSR\n==================\n\nEvery time you use a styled-component that component has to become a client component by using the directive `'use client'` . This takes away the benefit of server components, If you aren’t aware of, server components means that you could do an actual DB read or API fetch server side and suspend that component while rendering a loading state very fast to the user. This is very powerful aspect of NextJS as you can have multiple components in a page that start fetching data on the server side before the user even gets the entire HTML and while their browser reads, transpiles and renders the DOM, CSS, etc… You are already ahead in calling your APIs or DBs.\nSo… If you say I’m willing to not use server component or do workarounds to use them, then you can go ahead on using styled-components 😄. I personally really enjoyed doing CSS-in-JS, so, *in some projects,* I made the difficult decision of letting some performance in the table for a different CSS management. **Configure Next JS**",
            "===\n\nI suppose you already have a working NextJS project using App Router. So, let’s start by configuring the server side stylesheet with styled-components.

This is yet again a similar situation where you’re modifying the DOM directly. If you are using refs to add some content inside your HTML elements, use innerText instead.",

The excerpts that most directly support this claim are those that lay out high-leverage data fetching patterns and best practices that are broadly applicable across many React/Next.js Remix scenarios: data fetching patterns and best practices emphasize parallel data fetching, caching, memoization, and when to use server- vs client-side data strategies; these are the core levers that drive developer productivity and coverage across CRUD-like workflows. Additionally, excerpts that discuss forming patterns (react-hook-form with Zod for forms, server-actions/server loaders, and routing/layout patterns in Next.js/Remix) reinforce the idea that a compact, framework-native toolkit can handle a large portion of common workload. The presence of guidance on routing, nesting layouts, and parallel/intercepting routes further substantiates the claim that a small, principled pattern set can cover a broad spectrum of typical app needs, aligning with the Pareto-type framing in the field value. Quotes from these excerpts illustrate the 95% coverage through: - \"There are a few recommended patterns and best practices for fetching data in React and Next.js… parallel data fetching reduces waterfalls\" - \"With parallel data fetching, requests in a route are eagerly initiated and will load data at the same time\" - \"Patterns like API routes, loaders, actions, and form handling via server components and server actions\" - \"mastering a server-centric approach for CRUD operations and data mutations\" - \"forms with react-hook-form + Zod cover state, validation, and performance for large forms\" - ",

            "Feature flags (or toggles) are conditionals in your application that enable or disable specific features based on predefined criteria. **Progressive Rollouts** : Gradually release features to specific user groups (e.g., beta testers). 2. **A/B Testing** : Test different versions of features for better UX or performance. 3. **Quick Rollbacks** : Disable buggy features instantly without a new deployment. 4. **Personalized Experiences** : Enable features based on user roles or preferences. # Feature Flag Libraries for React\n\nHere are popular libraries and services that simplify feature flagging:\n\n1. [**LaunchDarkly**](https://launchdarkly.com/)\n\n* Enterprise-grade feature flagging as a service. * Offers robust SDKs for React and other platforms. * Supports dynamic flags, analytics, and targeting rules. [**2\\. Unleash**](https://www.getunleash.io/)\n\n* Open-source feature management tool. * Self-hosted or cloud options. * JSON-based configuration for flags with SDK support. [**3\\. React Feature Flags**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-feature-flags)\n\n* Lightweight React-specific library. * Simple API for creating and toggling flags. [**4\\. Flagsmith**](https://flagsmith.com/)\n\n* Open-source and SaaS options for feature management. * Offers advanced analytics and integrations. # Implementing Feature Flags in React\n\n## Example: Feature Flags with `react-feature-flags`\n\nThis lightweight library is great for basic implementations. Let’s build a feature-flagged component.\n## Step 1: Install the Library\n\n```\nnpm install react-feature-flags\n```\n\n## Step 2: Create a Feature Flag Context\n\n```\nimport { FlagsProvider, useFeatureFlag } from 'react-feature-flags';  const App = () => {   const flags = { newFeature: false }; // Define your flags here    return (     <FlagsProvider value={flags}>       <MainApp />     </FlagsProvider>   ); };\n```\n\n## Step 3: Use Flags in Components\n\n```\nconst NewFeature = () => <div>Welcome to the new feature!</div>;  const MainApp = () => {   const isFeatureEnabled = useFeatureFlag('newFeature');    return (     <div>       <h1>Main App</h1>       {isFeatureEnabled ? <NewFeature /> : <p>Old Experience</p>}     </div>   ); };\n```\n\n## Step 4: Dynamically Update Flags\n\nFlags can be dynamically updated via API calls or configuration changes, ensuring real-time control over feature availability. # Rollout Strategies\n\n## 1\\. Gradual Rollouts\n\n* Release features incrementally, starting with a small percentage of users. * Use services like LaunchDarkly to define rollout rules (e.g., by geography or user role). ## 2\\. Role-Based Features\n\n* Activate features for specific user roles, such as admins or beta testers. ```\nconst flags = { adminFeature: user.role === 'admin' };\n```\n\n## 3\\. A/B Testing\n\n* Define multiple flags for different feature variants. * Analyze user engagement to determine the best variant. ## 4\\. Environment-Specific Flags\n\n* Configure flags based on environments like production, staging, or developm",

            "Pure functions only calculate, so calling them twice won’t change anything",
            "While functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, _something_ has to change. That’s kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called **side effects. ** They’re things that happen _“on the side”_ , not during rendering. In React, **side effects usually belong inside [event handlers. ](/learn/responding-to-events)** Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined _inside_ your component, they don’t run _during_ rendering! **So event handlers don’t need to be pure. *",
            "If you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. **However, this approach should be your last resort. **",

Excerpts that explicitly name the Testing Library family, RTL, user-event, and jest-dom provide direct evidence for the recommended testing stack and practices. Excerpts that discuss MSW as a means to mock network requests in tests align with the field value's emphasis on end-to-end and integration testing realism. Additional excerpts outlining guiding principles for Testing Library (emphasizing testing from the user's perspective, and using role-based queries) reinforce the core philosophy quoted in the field value. Supplemental excerpts mentioning end-to-end or integration testing strategies, while not RTL-specific, help situate RTL within the broader testing ecosystem and hence are supportive evidence. Overall, the most direct and strongest matches are the passages that state: use RTL for component testing, use user-event for simulating interactions, employ jest-dom for readable assertions, and mock APIs with MSW for reliable integration tests. The supporting material around accessibility, test architecture, and broader testing tools further corroborates the fine-grained value. ",

It also notes that both approaches enable theming, such as dark mode, via CSS custom properties. Excerpts that directly discuss Tailwind's rapid development and design-system-out-of-the-box capabilities support the Tailwind portion of the claim. Excerpts that describe Vanilla Extract's co-located, type-safe styling, build-time CSS generation, and theming support substantiate the Vanilla Extract portion. Excerpts mentioning design tokens, theming contracts, and CSS variables provide context for how both approaches achieve theming and dynamic styling features like dark mode. Together, these excerpts corroborate the comparative performance/UX and design-system implications claimed in the field value, and illustrate how theming can be implemented in both ecosystems. Specifically, phrasing such as Tailwind offering rapid development via utility classes and a design system fits the field value's first clause; Vanilla Extract's TypeScript-based, co-located styling and zero-runtime or build-time CSS aligns with the second clause; and mentions of CSS variables and theming approaches underpin the shared theming capability cited in the field value. For additional context, references to Vanilla Extract's next-plugin integration and its zero-runtime styling model reinforce the claim about build-time CSS generation and precomputation advantages, while discussions of design tokens and tokens-based theming illuminate how both ecosystems accommodate dynamic themes like dark mode.",

Excerpt describing Vanilla Extract as designed to generate static CSS files at build time explicitly supports the zero-runtime, no-runtime-parse-and-inject model, directly aligning with the performance claim. Another excerpt reiterates the zero-runtime stylesheet concept for Vanilla Extract, reinforcing that the approach generates static CSS at build time, which underpins faster load and TTI characteristics. A third excerpt further states the static CSS-file generation at build time for Vanilla Extract in a generic sense (vanilla-extract/css) and mentions zero-runtime stylesheets, which again substantiates the performance angle. A fourth excerpt provides a similar build-time statics-focused description in the Vanilla Extract Next.js integration context, linking build-time evaluation to no-runtime CSS inclusion. Finally, an excerpt explicitly discusses performance benefits in terms of Time To Interactive (TTI) when using zero-runtime/compile-time styling approaches, which directly supports the performance impact claim. Taken together, these excerpts form a coherent chain: build-time static CSS generation (zero-runtime) leads to smaller client bundles and faster TTI, which matches the stated fine-grained field value. The extra excerpts provide broader context about related CSS-in-JS and RSC discussions but do not override the direct build-time/performance claims above.",

Collectively, these excerpts connect the exact phrasing about resembling user interactions with the broader doctrine of testing from a user perspective to derive higher confidence in test outcomes. The first excerpt explicitly links principle to confidence gained from user-centric testing. The second excerpt reinforces the idea by emphasizing that the tests should resemble user interactions and page usage.

For example, a definition of zero-runtime CSS in JS describes writing CSS inside JavaScript and generating CSS files at build time, which aligns with the idea of moving styling work to build time and producing static styles. Descriptions of Vanilla Extract present it as a zero-runtime CSS-in-TypeScript solution that writes styles in TypeScript and then generates static CSS files during the build, which is a concrete instantiation of the stated paradigm. Other excerpts discuss compiling or extracting styles at build time (compile-time processing) and emphasize the non-runtime nature of the styling work, which corroborates the core idea. Several passages frame this approach in the context of React Server Components and compile-time tooling, highlighting that processing happens outside the client lifecycle and often before runtime, which reinforces the notion of eliminating runtime overhead. Additional entries describe Next.js integrations and tooling that evaluate CSS-in-TypeScript at build time, further illustrating the practical realization of a build-time, static stylesheet paradigm. Taken together, these excerpts consistently support the notion that the approach mixes utility-oriented patterns (utility-first) with a compile-time, zero-runtime CSS strategy, where CSS is generated and emitted as static files during the build process, thereby removing client-side styling work at runtime.",

Excerpt describing CSS-in-React Server Components and the idea that processing happens at compile-time directly supports this: it emphasizes a model where styling is determined without relying on client lifecycle and that preprocessing can occur ahead of time, aligning with SSR/RSC compatibility. A developer guide about CSS-in-JS and React Server Components notes how these approaches leverage compile-time work and are not bound to the React runtime in the same way as classic runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, which reinforces the compatibility claim. Documentation on vanilla-extract and related zero-runtime styling explicitly describes writing styles that are compiled to static CSS files at build time, which is exactly the kind of SSR-friendly approach the field value advocates. Next.js-specific guidance shows how to integrate zero-runtime or SSR-friendly styling within an app router and server-rendered contexts, including setups that extract styles on the server and inject them into the head, which demonstrates practical SSR-compatible wiring. References that discuss compile-time libraries (e.g., Linaria and similar approaches) further illustrate the paradigm of moving styling work out of the client lifecycle, strengthening the argument for SSR-friendly strategies. The collected excerpts thus collectively support the notion that fully SSR/RSC-compatible styling strategies exist and are preferable for avoiding client-only constraints, especially when contrasted with runtime CSS-in-JS libraries that require a client directive and are not naturally compatible with server components.",

      "reasoning": "The most relevant excerpts directly align with the field value's core claims. The guiding principles emphasize that tests should resemble user interactions and how pages are used, which underpins the recommended ordering of queries (preferring user-facing approaches like role-based queries). Paralleling this, guidance that advocates using queries such as getByRole aligns with prioritizing user-facing queries in tests. Documentation that explicitly discusses the Testing Library's guiding principles reinforces why those queries are preferred and how tests should mirror user behavior. Excerpts that discuss getByRole and related user-centric querying directly support the recommended approach to prioritizing user-facing queries in tests. Evidence that MSW exists as a standalone API mocking layer confirms the network-mabang capability to mock API responses at the network level for reliable integration tests, matching the field value's MSW recommendation. The MSW documentation also states its framework-agnostic nature, which supports its use across testing setups. Excerpts mentioning a11y-focused testing within RTL contexts (e.g., axe-core integration) substantiate the accessibility checks component of the field value. Finally, references to render helpers and wrapping components with Providers (Context/Router) corroborate the recommendation to create or use custom render helpers to wrap tests with necessary providers. Taken together, these excerpts collectively validate the field value's components and ordering: user-facing queries prioritized, MSW for API mocking, render helpers for provider wrappers, and integrating automated accessibility checks.",
