  "input": "Of course. Here is a prompt tailored to find and catalog underrated but viral images that explain mental models.\n\nThis prompt is designed to help the AI distinguish between common, overused visuals and the kind of unique, insightful diagrams that gain traction in niche intellectual communities.\n\nUnderrated Mental Models Visual Library Prompt\nResearch Briefing & Objective:\n\nYou are a Knowledge Curator for a popular newsletter focused on clear thinking and effective decision-making. Your mission is to create a visual library of \"hidden gem\" mental models—powerful concepts that are not widely known but have gone viral within specific communities due to their insightful visuals.\n\nPhase 1: Search & Selection Criteria\n\nYour goal is to find high-quality images that visually explain a mental model. Each image must meet all of the following conditions:\n\nVisual Insight: The image must be a diagram, infographic, or visual metaphor that makes a complex mental model easy to grasp instantly.\n\nUnderrated Concept: The image must represent a mental model outside of the commonly cited top 20 (e.g., you should actively exclude basic diagrams of Occam's Razor, First Principles Thinking, Confirmation Bias, etc.). The goal is to find novel visuals for concepts like the Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect, Chesterton's Fence, Circle of Competence, or The Map is Not the Territory.\n\nViral Indicator: The image must show evidence of organic virality. This can be verified if the image has:\n\nHigh engagement (e.g., thousands of retweets or pins) on a social platform.\n\nBeen featured or embedded across multiple independent, high-quality blogs or newsletters.\n\nPhase 2: Dataset Compilation & Final Deliverable\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format, with each row representing a single, unique mental model image.\n\nThe table must have the following exact headers:\n\nImage_URL (A direct link to the image file)\n\nMentalModel_Name\n\nCorePrinciple\n\nApplication\n\nSourceType\n\nOriginalSource_URL (The URL of the article or post where the image originated)\n\nConstraint Checklist:\nMentalModel_Name: Name the specific mental model the image illustrates.\n\nCorePrinciple: Provide a one-sentence summary of the model's central idea.\n\nApplication: Briefly describe a real-world situation where this model is useful for thinking clearly.\n\nSourceType: Categorize the original source as Blog Post, Newsletter, Academic Paper, Book Illustration, or Social Media Thread.\n\nExclusions: Your primary filter is to reject overly common or simplistic models. The value of this list is in its novelty and depth. Do not include corporate or marketing framework diagrams.",

      "overall_summary": "The research to build a visual library of 'underrated but viral' mental models was executed through a multi-stage, parallelized process. The initial phase involved establishing an exclusion baseline by identifying the 20-30 most common mental models (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Pareto Principle) and their canonical visuals to ensure the final collection met the 'underrated' criterion. Subsequently, targeted searches were conducted on specific high-value sources known for visual explanations, including Sketchplanations.com, rationality blogs (LessWrong, Slate Star Codex), Substack newsletters, and major infographic hubs like Visual Capitalist. Deep-dive investigations were performed for specific, requested models such as Chesterton's Fence, the Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect, Circle of Competence, and Goodhart's Law to find multiple, high-quality visual examples and validate their organic virality through public engagement metrics and evidence of cross-platform embedding. The research also explored non-English sources and synthesized the underlying patterns of what makes a mental model visual successful. The outcome is a curated collection of novel visuals, a clear understanding of which concepts are visually well-represented versus which are not, and a set of actionable insights for creating future viral educational content.",
      "successful_visual_finds": "Strong, viral, and novel visuals were successfully identified for several mental models. 'Chesterton's Fence' yielded multiple high-quality examples, most notably the annotated sketch from Sketchplanations which showed significant engagement on X/Twitter and Facebook. 'Goodhart's Law' and 'The Cobra Effect' were also successfully visualized by Sketchplanations, with evidence of their use in professional and academic contexts. 'Circle of Competence' and 'The Map is Not the Territory' were found to have highly novel and viral minimalist/abstract depictions from creators like Visualize Value and Sahil Bloom, moving beyond clichéd diagrams. The rationality blog-sphere provided potent, albeit more technical, visuals for 'Goodhart's Law' (causal diagrams from LessWrong) and a novel concept, 'The Tails Coming Apart' (from Slate Star Codex), which showed massive community engagement. Meta-models like the 'Barbell Strategy' were also successfully visualized in a Substack newsletter.",
      "challenging_visual_finds": "Finding distinct, viral visuals proved difficult for several key mental models. The 'Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect' was the most challenging; despite the concept's textual popularity in online discussions (Hacker News, Reddit), no explanatory diagrams or infographics with significant organic virality were discovered. The visuals found were either text-as-image quotes or generic stock photos. Similarly, 'Shifting Baseline Syndrome' and the 'Streetlight Effect' yielded very few explanatory visuals, with the ones found (e.g., scientific charts, Wikipedia diagrams) lacking evidence of broad, organic spread outside of niche academic or encyclopedic contexts. For many concepts, the 'virality' was attached to the text-based idea itself, not to a shareable visual aid, highlighting a gap between conceptual popularity and visual explanation."

    "synthesis_of_viral_patterns": {
      "visual_form": "The most successful visual formats are those that prioritize clarity and immediate comprehension. Key forms include: **Infographics**, especially with vertical layouts for mobile scrolling (e.g., Sloww.co's 'Chesterton's Fence'); **Annotated Sketches**, which use a hand-drawn, approachable aesthetic (e.g., Sketchplanations); **Metaphorical Imagery**, which uses a concrete image to represent an abstract idea (e.g., a photo of a fence for Chesterton's Fence); **Quote Images**, which place a powerful text definition on a simple background (e.g., the Gell-Mann Amnesia quote on X); and **Short-Form Videos** (e.g., the TikTok explanation of Chesterton's Fence), which adapt concepts for dynamic, bite-sized consumption.",
      "channel_analysis": "Channel effectiveness is highly dependent on the visual format and target audience. **X/Twitter** is potent for static images and quote cards that can be quickly consumed and shared, amplified by influential accounts. **Instagram** and **Pinterest** are premier platforms for high-quality, visually striking infographics and diagrams, with Instagram's vertical format (1080x1350px) performing best. **LinkedIn** is ideal for professional audiences, where carousel posts and document attachments explaining business-relevant models like the 'Circle of Competence' see high engagement. **Blogs and Newsletters (Substack)** serve as foundational hubs for providing detailed context, often acting as the origin point before a visual is shared more broadly. **TikTok** excels at reaching younger demographics with creative, short-form video but can lead to shallower processing.",
      "virality_correlates": "Several key factors consistently correlate with a visual's ability to spread organically. **Strong Storytelling** is paramount; visuals that frame a model within a relatable narrative (e.g., the nail factory for Goodhart's Law) are more memorable. **Simplicity and Clarity**, adhering to a 'one big idea' principle, are crucial, as the brain processes images far faster than text. **Visually Striking Design** with a clear hierarchy and clean aesthetic captures initial attention. **Credibility**, established by citing sources and using verified data, builds trust and encourages sharing. Finally, **Creator Reputation and Network Effects** play a significant role; visuals launched by established creators (e.g., Visualize Value, Sketchplanations) or amplified by influencers receive an initial boost that can catalyze wider spread.",
      "common_pitfalls": "Several common mistakes hinder a visual's potential for virality. **Information Overload** is the most frequent issue, where creators try to cram too much text or data into a single image, making it cluttered and difficult to digest. **Poor Design**, including weak typography, a confusing layout, or a clashing color palette, causes users to disengage immediately. A critical technical error is **Not Optimizing for Mobile**, as most social media is consumed on vertical phone screens. Other pitfalls include a **Lack of Promotion** across relevant channels, the absence of a clear **Call-to-Action** (CTA) to guide user behavior, and **Factual Inaccuracies** that destroy credibility.",
      "design_recommendations": "To design future visuals for maximum viral potential, creators should: 1. **Start with a Single, Potent Idea** and build the entire visual around explaining it clearly. 2. **Design for Scanning, Not Reading**, using a strong headline, clear visual hierarchy, and minimal text. 3. **Prioritize Mobile-First, Vertical Formats** (e.g., 1080x1350px) as the primary deliverable. 4. **Build in Credibility** by explicitly citing sources on the visual itself. 5. **Tell a Relatable Story** or use a powerful metaphor to make the abstract concept concrete and memorable. 6. **Develop a Multi-Channel Promotion Plan** to distribute the visual across a primary blog/newsletter and multiple social platforms tailored to the format. 7. **Include a Clear CTA** and a subtle brand mark to encourage sharing and build recognition."

First, Chesterton's Fence visuals are highlighted as high-visibility, viral exemplars (identifying that Chesterton's Fence visuals exist and have broad engagement and cross-platform presence). The excerpts show multiple treatments of Chesterton's Fence across Sketchplanations, social posts, and other outlets, illustrating the claimed virality and cross-platform embedding that the summary flags as a success case. Next, Circle of Competence is repeatedly described across various sources (fan pages, Wikipedia, Farnam Street-related materials, and substack visualizations), demonstrating how the field identifies a non-trivial, widely discussed mental model with robust visual representations. Then, Gell-Mann Amnesia is presented through a spectrum of posts across blogs, substack, and social media that illustrate the phenomenon and its visualization in contemporary discourse, aligning with the summary's emphasis on model-wide viral visuals and cross-platform discussion. Goodhart's Law is represented in several framed visuals and discussions (Sketchplanations, LessWrong taxonomy, and related posts), supporting the summary's claim of diverse, diagrammatic representations and cross-domain applicability. Collectively these excerpts also corroborate phase-based research activity: targeted sources (Sketchplanations, Visual Capitalist, Sahil Bloom, LessWrong) are cited as primary visual engines, while cross-platform virality and embedding are evidenced by excerpts describing engagement on Twitter/X, Facebook, and other channels. The excerpts further reflect the two-tier pattern described in the field value: some models have strong, well-supported visuals (e.g., Chesterton's Fence and Circle of Competence), while others (like Gell-Mann Amnesia visuals) show variable but notable discourse and reference points across multiple domains. The combination of specific model cases, source ecosystems, and virality signals directly maps to the field's description of a phase-driven, multi-source, multilingual exploration process, with a curated set of visuals and actionable insights for future discovery.",

For Chesterton's Fence, the excerpts explicitly define the principle as a rule to not remove or alter a fence without understanding why it is there, and they frequently discuss second-order thinking and the rationale behind existing structures. They also present the concept visually and in multiple formats, which matches the visual-library framing in the field value. For Circle of Competence, the excerpts clearly name the model, describe the boundary concept, and provide investing-oriented and general-context explanations, often with illustrations or references to Buffett and Munger, which directly supports the field value path that focuses on a visual library of underrated but viral mental models. For The Map Is Not The Territory, the excerpts explicitly state that maps are representations, not reality, and many include visuals comparing maps to territory, sometimes in data-visualization contexts, which directly connects to the field value describing undervalued but viral visuals around this model. In each case, the most relevant excerpts present the exact model name, a concise core principle, and mention of its application or a visual depiction, sometimes including virality indicators. The partial matches that discuss related concepts (e.g., general thinking tools or other mental models) are still useful as context but are placed lower in relevance since they do not directly name the target model or provide a direct visualization for that model. The combination of explicit model naming, core principle statements, and visual/virality cues across these excerpts collectively supports the fine-grained field value for the three specified mental models.\n",

Survivorship Bias is described as a classic, frequently mentioned bias across top lists, matching the exclusion rationale for a pervasive, widely repeated concept. The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) is described with specific attention to its visualization and common usage (Pareto Chart), which fits the exclusion criterion of a widely used, high-visibility principle in decision-making and prioritization. Taken together, these excerpts directly substantiate the existence and prominence of the three targeted exclusion items, supporting their relevance for the fine-grained field under consideration.

Additional excerpts discuss Metcalfe's Law and general mental models catalogues, which again pertain to the broader field but do not provide evidence about the Dunning-Kruger visual being overused or universally recognized. Therefore, while the excerpts are thematically related to mental models and biases and may provide contextual grounding about what constitutes a mental model diagram, they do not substantively confirm or refute the exact finegrained field value about excluding the Dunning-Kruger visual due to its fame and overuse. The strongest relevance comes from content that explicitly frames biases and mental models, but none directly address the Dunning-Kruger exclusion criterion, which limits strong support.",

      "reasoning": "- The Circle of Competence is highlighted as a mental model that reminds us about knowledge boundaries, including attribution to Buffett and Munger, which directly supports the inclusion of this model as part of an underrated-but-viral visual library. This establishes both the model's relevance and its visual representation potential. The related excerpts expand on the idea that such diagrams help avoid overreach by focusing on what one truly understands, aligning with the research goal of curating novel visuals that communicate complex ideas simply. - The Map is Not the Territory excerpts articulate a core metaphor about differences between belief and reality and how abstractions can mislead, which is a classic but often-underrepresented mental model suitable for inclusion in a curated library of underrated visuals. They confirm the kind of nontrivial concepts that can gain attention for their explanatory power. - The Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect passages describe a phenomenon about trusting sources on unfamiliar topics while recognizing inaccuracies elsewhere, which supports identifying a nuanced, less-cited concept that could become viral through clear visuals. This matches the target of finding \"hidden gem\" mental models with viral potential. - Goodhart's Law excerpts (and its RL-specific discussion) illustrate a well-known but sometimes overlooked model about optimizing proxies, which fits the criterion of underrated concepts that can gain traction when visually explained. These excerpts reinforce the value of including such concepts in the visual library, especially when there is cross-context applicability. - Chesterton's Fence excerpts provide a canonical yet not-always-top-20 model regarding evaluating existing structures before removing them, contributing to the diversity of models considered for the library and offering a candidate for underviewed visual explanations. - The Chesterton-related notes and Circle of Competence-related notes from various sources (Sketchplanations, Perspectiveship, Visualized sources) demonstrate that multiple independent outlets discuss these models, aligning with Phase 1's viral-indication criterion (evidence of independent cross-platform discussion). - The references to Visualize Value and other outlets illustrate potential sources for the \"viral indicator\" criterion—showing how models are discussed, shared, and repackaged—supporting Phase 2's data collection through diverse, high-visibility platforms. - Collectively, these excerpts corroborate the structured approach described in the field value: exclude overly common models, seek undervalued but explainer-friendly visuals, validate virality via cross-platform presence, and assemble a final CSV with metadata about each model. - Some excerpts provide direct mentions of the named models and their general framing, while others illustrate the kinds of outlets and approach used to assemble the library, which together support the notion of a multi-source, multi-stage research process. - In summary, the most directly supportive content centers on specific underrated mental models (Circle of Competence, The Map is Not the Territory, Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect, Goodhart's Law, Chesterton's Fence) and on the sourcing/multi-source validation approach, which aligns with the described research summary field value. The rest adds contextual scaffolding but is less central to proving the field value's core claims.",

Additional context is provided by excerpts that define the circle of competence and explain that there is an edge where expertise ends and outside uncertainty begins, reinforcing that awareness of boundaries is central to applying the model effectively. Supporting entries further illustrate the concept by describing how Warren Buffett uses a straightforward, bounded scope to avoid problems, and by noting the practical guidance of recognizing where you have edge and where you don't, which helps prevent problems and identify opportunities.

Specifically, the excerpts describing the fence and its rationale (not taking down a fence without understanding why) reflect the visual treatment and the emphasis on a concept that attained engagement in the visual-education space. The Circle of Competence is another strongly relevant thread, as multiple excerpts explicitly describe this mental model and its use in framing knowledge boundaries, including references to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, which supports both the model's existence and its visual treatment in popular media. Content about The Map is Not the Territory provides context about a distinct, widely-circulated metaphor, and the excerpts show how it has been translated into visuals across various outlets, which is consistent with the field value emphasizing novel and viral minimalist/abstract depictions from creators. Excerpts that discuss Visualize Value and related creators (Sahil Bloom, etc.) reinforce the viral-visual aspect by connecting credible, high-visibility sources to the depiction of these models, supporting the field value's claim about novel visuals achieving virality. Content mentioning Gell-Ma n Amnesia and Gell-Mann-related discussions also indicate a broader ecosystem of ideas where visual explanations gained traction, even if not all of these items are the exact models named in the field value; their inclusion helps demonstrate the surrounding virality culture and visual storytelling approaches. Finally, the goodhart-related excerpts from LessWrong and related discussions provide evidence for the field value's note about Goodhart's Law being portrayed through causal diagrams and in other professional contexts, which corroborates the existence of viral, well-supported visuals for at least some of the models named in the field value. Taken together, the most directly relevant items are those that explicitly map Chesterton's Fence visuals to engagement, followed by Circle of Competence descriptions, Map/territory visuals, and then broader viral-visual ecosystem references (Visualize Value, Sahil Bloom, and Goodhart's Law discussions).",

Excerpts that discuss underground or underrated mental-model visuals that have virality signals directly address the core objective of curating visuals with high sharing potential and documented reach. Specifically, passages that reference a collection of visuals on mental models with virality indicators and the emphasis on compiling image-based visuals align with the synthesis of viral pattern design recommendations. The discussion of Chesterton's Fence visuals and the accompanying explanations about why a fence exists, and the broader framing of visual prompts for underrated mental models, provide concrete examples of how to convey a complex idea through a diagram or metaphor, which supports the guidance to design for clarity, a strong visual hierarchy, and memorable framing. Additional items that note the existence of compilations or newsletters featuring such visuals, with virality signals, reinforce the need to publish in accessible formats (e.g., Substack newsletters) and to include clear citations and sources on the visuals themselves. Taken together, these excerpts support the idea that effective, viral-friendly mental-model visuals emerge from a focused central idea, scannable and mobile-optimized design, credible sourcing, relatable storytelling, and a strategic content-distribution plan. The strongest support comes from explicit mentions of underrated-visual compilations with virality indicators, which map directly onto the claimed design principles, while the Chesterton-focused items illustrate how clear metaphors and structured visuals can convey specific mental models in a viral-friendly way.",

For instance, a snippet describing a Substack newsletter visuals collection with virality indicators foregrounds the relevance of measurable popularity signals in the virality landscape. Another excerpt explicitly notes a compilation of underrated mental models with image URLs and virality indicators, which directly aligns with the idea of optimizing for virality rather than default or obvious concepts. These passages help connect the field value—common virality pitfalls—to real-world signals of what makes visuals spread, such as engagement metrics and cross-platform presence. Other excerpts discuss the content and origin of specific mental models (e.g., Chesterton's Fence or Circle of Competence) which, while informative about the visuals themselves, provide indirect support by indicating the kinds of content that may or may not be optimized for broad appeal. Taken together, the most relevant material centers on virality signals and curated visual examples, while adjacent material on individual mental models offers contextual support but does not directly address the specified pitfalls.",

For example, one excerpt describes a compilation of underrated mental-model visuals with virality indicators, which directly supports the idea that visuals gain traction when they show engagement and cross-posting or replication across independent sources. Another excerpt notes that the visuals are compiled with image URLs and virality indicators, reinforcing the link between credible sourcing, visibility across platforms, and spread. A third excerpt mentions diagrams and the concept of viral visuals in the context of an image-based library, which aligns with the emphasis on strong storytelling and clear design that accompanies viral spread. Beyond these, other excerpts discuss Chesterton's Fence and Circle of Competence as specific mental models conveyed through visuals; while informative about the content, they do not directly discuss virality factors, so they are supportive context rather than core evidence for the virality correlates field. An additional excerpt discusses the Overton window and related topics, which is tangential to virality factors and thus less directly relevant. A remaining item mentions a variety of argumentative experiences and Goodhart's law in a diagram, which could touch on design clarity or topicality, but again does not provide explicit virality indicators. Overall, the strongest support comes from excerpts that explicitly tie visuals to virality indicators and compilation with virality data, followed by excerpts that discuss the visual presentation of specific mental models, and finally by those with related but non-virality content. The direct quotes illustrating virality indicators and compilation with virality data are the most compelling support for the finegrained field value.",

Excerpts that describe specific types of visuals (infographics, annotated sketches, metaphorical imagery, quote images, short-form videos) align with the finegrained field value's explicit formats and are therefore highly relevant.

The most relevant content explicitly references compilations of visuals in a Substack newsletter with virality indicators, which aligns with understanding how a visual library gains traction in niche communities and how virality is evidenced for underrated concepts. For example, descriptions like \"The following Substack newsletter visuals on mental models (underrated): compilation with image URLs and virality indicators\" directly connect visuals, their hosting channel (Substack), and the emplaced virality signals that make such visuals effective for narrow audiences. A closely related excerpt reiterates the same Substack-compiled visuals and virality indicators, reinforcing the idea that Substack serves as an origin or hub from which visuals propagate. These two excerpts provide concrete anchors for how channel choice and virality signals contribute to channel effectiveness. Additionally, there are excerpts that identify the specific mental models discussed (Chesterton's Fence and Circle of Competence) in connection with a visual prompt, which helps link the content (novel visuals around less-cited concepts) to the broader strategy of choosing and explaining models visually. The other excerpts contribute contextual detail about the specific mental models being discussed (e.g., Chesterton's Fence) and general descriptions of the concepts, which supports understanding of what kinds of visuals are being promoted, though they do not directly discuss platform channels or virality indicators. Collectively, these excerpts map the relationship between the format and platform used to disseminate visual explanations and the viral reach such visuals can achieve within specialized communities, which is the core of the requested fine-grained field value.

Another excerpt notes that the size of the circle is less important than knowing when you are approaching the perimeter, reinforcing the idea of operating within a known edge to prevent problems—an idea that naturally extends to investing and to broader decision contexts like business and personal development. Additional excerpts describe having a circle of competence as an area in which one has earned knowledge, which supports the notion of applying the model to decision-making in specialized domains (investing) and to recognizing knowledge gaps in other areas.

Excerpts that explicitly frame the map-not-the-territory distinction provide foundational support for understanding why such a visualization can be powerful and viral in illustrating a mental model. Excerpts describing the origin or presentation of map visuals (including standard explanations and image-focused references) also help corroborate the general concept that visual representations of maps can function as insightful diagrams. However, none of the excerpts provides the specific virality evidence (Reddit engagement, BuzzFeed features, etc.) for the exact animated GIF in question. As a result, the strongest support comes from passages that articulate the map-not-territory concept and the value of map-like visuals, while the virality specifics remain unsubstantiated within these excerpts. All cited pieces align with the idea that map-based visuals can convey complex ideas clearly, which is consistent with why such an image could become viral, but the explicit virality claim in the field value is not directly evidenced by the excerpts provided.",

Excerpt 3 elaborates on the same infographic and describes one key example (Metcalfe's Law) within that visual, reinforcing the notion of a single, relatively canonical graphic used to convey a mental model across audiences. Together, these excerpts directly support the notion of a widely distributed, single-visual representation that achieves viral/dissemination status. Excerpt 0 discusses a well-known compilation of mental models (including falsification and confirmation bias) but does not clearly indicate a single, universally recognized visual; it points to familiar, widely cited content, which is related but less directly aligned with the specific idea of a singular universal visual artifact. Excerpt 1 references James Clear and survivorship bias, again indicating established material but not explicitly describing a universal single-visual artifact. Therefore, the strongest support for the finegrained field value comes from the mention of an infographic that consolidates many mental models into one visual, followed by corroborating details in the same source.

It is further reinforced by notes that the idea originated with GK Chesterton and should prompt understanding of the original purpose before replacing or removing it. Additional context points out that, in the spirit of progress, there is a tendency to discard old designs, laws, or institutions, but Chesterton's Fence reminds us to consider their purpose first. These points together directly corroborate the target field value, which is the specific mental model name associated with this principle. The combination of a direct definition, historical origin, and cautions about premature removal provides cohesive support for identifying the mental model as Chesterton's Fence.",

Several excerpts emphasize that before removing an old design, law, or institution, one should comprehend why it existed; this directly supports the idea of evaluating underlying rationale and potential secondary effects prior to change. Additionally, there is a cautious note about assuming the original designers were less capable, reinforcing the value of understanding origins before acting.
