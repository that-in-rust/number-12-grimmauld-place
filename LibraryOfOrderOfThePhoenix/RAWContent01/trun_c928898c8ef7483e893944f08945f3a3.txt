  "input": "I want to create visual diagrams to create decision flows for Constituition of India which is made of full text. I will use LLMs to do this. What is the best way to appraoch this - which tool - mermaid diagrams or something else will help me do this - also for those tools what will be the optimum type of LLM Prompts -- Deeply research this and craft creative options to do this - the 2 constitution docs can be found at https://github.com/before-i-go/law-diagrams/tree/main/.zzRef - 2 original PDF files - and 1 extracted pdftotxt file - https://github.com/before-i-go/law-diagrams/tree/main/RAWDATA",
  "output": {
    "project_summary": {
      "key_finding": "The primary and most crucial finding is that the user's goal of creating visual diagrams for the Constitution of India has already been fully realized. The GitHub repository `before-i-go/law-diagrams`, which the user identified as a source for documents, is in fact a completed project that has successfully converted the entire Constitution of India into a comprehensive set of visual diagrams using Mermaid.js.",
      "project_name": "before-i-go/law-diagrams",
      "project_status": "The project is documented as 'SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED' as of September 23, 2025. The repository contains a `FINAL_CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md` file, which asserts that the project has achieved its goal with 100% coverage and quality assurance.",
      "primary_tool_used": "Mermaid.js was the exclusive diagramming tool used for this project. This choice validates the user's initial consideration and is ideal for LLM-based workflows due to its text-based, Markdown-like syntax which is easily generated and version-controlled.",
      "scope_and_coverage": "The project achieved 100% coverage of the Constitution of India. It systematically analyzed 20,115 lines of constitutional text, encompassing all 22 Parts, 395 Articles, and 12 Schedules, and is updated to reflect all changes up to the Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act, 2023.",
      "output_summary": "The project produced a total of 39 distinct and comprehensive Mermaid diagrams. These diagrams are organized logically and stored as individual Markdown (`.md`) files in the `Mermaid01/` directory. The diagrams are designed with a consistent vertical (Top-Down) layout for mobile-friendliness and use thematic color schemes for clarity."
    },
    "recommended_approach": {
      "primary_recommendation": "Do not start from scratch. The most effective and efficient approach is to leverage the existing, completed work in the `before-i-go/law-diagrams` repository. This project has already accomplished the goal of converting the Constitution of India into a full set of visual diagrams, providing a high-quality, comprehensive resource that likely meets or exceeds the user's requirements.",
      "step_1_explore_existing_work": "Your first action should be to thoroughly explore the 39 completed Mermaid diagrams located in the `Mermaid01/` directory of the repository. Since GitHub natively renders Mermaid syntax within Markdown files, you can view the diagrams directly in your browser. Assess whether these diagrams, which cover the entire constitution, are suitable for your decision-flow analysis needs. The repository's `README.md` also provides a 'Complete Navigation Map' and 'User Journeys' to guide your exploration.",
      "step_2_verify_licensing": "This is a critical and mandatory step before any reuse. The research could not identify a `LICENSE` file in the repository. In the absence of an explicit license, you must assume all rights are reserved by the author. Furthermore, the text of the Constitution of India itself is subject to government copyright. You must investigate the project's reuse rights, potentially by contacting the author directly, to ensure you can legally use, modify, or build upon the diagrams.",
      "contingency_plan": "If you determine the existing diagrams are unsuitable or you cannot secure reuse rights, you should still use the repository as a blueprint. To create your own diagrams, follow these best practices derived from the research: 1) **Use the Provided Source Text:** Start with the `EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt` file in the `RAWDATA/` directory. This saves you the error-prone step of PDF-to-text conversion. 2) **Adopt Mermaid.js:** The project's success confirms Mermaid.js is an excellent tool for this task. 3) **Use Existing Diagrams for Prompt Engineering:** Analyze the existing 39 diagrams to understand how legal text was translated into Mermaid syntax. Use them as few-shot examples in your LLM prompts to guide the model's output style, structure, and level of detail, incorporating the detailed prompt engineering patterns for extraction and generation found in the research."
    },
    "github_project_audit": {
      "repository_structure": "The project is exceptionally well-organized. The root directory contains comprehensive documentation (`README.md`, `PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `FINAL_CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md`, `MermaidTasks.md`). Source materials are logically separated: original PDFs are in `.zzRef/`, and the extracted plain text is in `RAWDATA/`. The final deliverables, 39 Mermaid diagram files, are located in `Mermaid01/`. A `.kiro/` directory contains internal project guidelines, including specifications and design patterns for creating the Mermaid diagrams.",
      "tooling_and_automation_level": "The project's tooling is straightforward and effective, but the workflow is primarily manual. The core tool is Mermaid.js for diagramming. A PDF-to-text conversion tool was used initially, and a custom Git alias (`acp`) was noted for streamlining commits. However, there is no evidence of automated build scripts (e.g., Makefiles), CI/CD pipelines, or LLM integration. The entire process, from text analysis to Mermaid code authoring and validation, appears to have been performed manually or with minimal scripting, indicating a high level of human effort.",
      "diagram_coverage_and_organization": "The project produced 39 unique Mermaid diagrams, achieving 100% coverage of the Constitution of India (all 22 Parts, 395 Articles, 12 Schedules, and amendments up to the 106th). The diagrams are highly organized, using a consistent `M[number]_[topic].md` naming convention. The main `README.md` provides a 'Complete Navigation Map' that categorizes the diagrams by topic (e.g., Government Structure, Judicial System) and offers 'User Journeys' to guide different audiences through the content.",
      "methodology": "The project's methodology was systematic and task-driven. The core strategy involved a manual chunking process where the 20,115-line source text was divided into 202 distinct tasks, each corresponding to a ~100-line segment of the constitution. This ensured the entire text was methodically analyzed. The workflow followed a clear sequence: PDF-to-text conversion, chunking, manual analysis of each chunk to identify structural and procedural logic, authoring of the corresponding Mermaid syntax, and a final validation step. There is no evidence that LLMs or automated prompts were used in the generation process.",
      "observed_strengths": "The project demonstrates several key strengths that serve as valuable lessons. The systematic 100-line chunking strategy is a highly effective and reusable method for tackling any large, dense document. The project's robust documentation, including detailed task tracking, a completion summary, and a final audit file, provides an excellent model for transparent and accountable project management. Finally, the strong focus on accessibility and usability, evidenced by the mobile-friendly vertical layouts and the creation of user-specific journey maps, is a major positive.",
      "identified_limitations": "The project has several notable limitations. It relies on a potentially flawed PDF-to-text conversion, explicitly disclaiming liability for OCR or formatting errors. The manual workflow makes the process labor-intensive, difficult to scale, and prone to human error. The output diagrams are static and non-interactive, lacking features like clickable nodes that link back to the source text. The scope is limited to the constitutional text itself, excluding crucial context like judicial interpretations or landmark case law. Lastly, the project is a static snapshot and lacks an automated mechanism to track and incorporate future constitutional amendments, meaning it will become outdated over time."

      "step_1_text_ingestion": "The pipeline begins with the ingestion of the authoritative source documents. As demonstrated in the `before-i-go/law-diagrams` project, this involves storing the original PDF versions of the Constitution (e.g., `COI_2024.pdf`) in a dedicated reference directory like `.zzRef`. A robust PDF-to-text conversion process is then applied to extract the raw, unstructured text. The output is a single, clean plain text file (e.g., `EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`) stored in a `RAWDATA` directory. This step is critical as it provides a standardized text source for all subsequent processing, but it must include a validation and correction sub-step to mitigate potential OCR inaccuracies or formatting loss, a risk acknowledged in the case study project.",
      "step_2_segmentation": "Once the raw text is extracted, it must be divided into smaller, manageable segments or chunks to fit within the context windows of Large Language Models (LLMs). The `law-diagrams` project provides a proven, practical example of a fixed-size chunking strategy, where it systematically divided the 20,115 lines of constitutional text into 202 tasks, each corresponding to an approximately 100-line chunk. A more theoretically optimal approach would be a hybrid strategy that first attempts structural chunking (by Article, Clause) to preserve legal context, followed by recursive chunking for very long articles to break them down further while respecting sentence and paragraph boundaries.",
      "step_3_logic_extraction": "This is the core intelligence step, powered by an LLM. Each text chunk from the segmentation step is fed to an LLM using a sophisticated prompt. The LLM's task is to perform deep analysis of the legal text to identify and extract key logical components: entities (e.g., President, Parliament), actors, conditions, procedural steps, actions, outcomes, and exceptions. The output of this step is not a diagram directly, but a structured, canonical JSON object that formally represents the extracted legal logic. This machine-readable intermediate representation decouples the logic extraction from the final visualization, making the pipeline more modular and robust.",
      "step_4_diagram_code_generation": "In this step, the structured JSON object representing the legal logic is converted into diagram-as-code syntax. This can be accomplished either programmatically with a script that maps JSON fields to diagram elements or, more flexibly, by using a second LLM call with a prompt specifically designed for code generation. The `law-diagrams` project provides a set of strict conventions that should be enforced here, such as generating Mermaid.js code, using a top-down graph direction (`graph TD`) for mobile-friendliness, employing systematic node IDs, and using subgraphs to organize complex sections. The output is a text file containing the diagram code (e.g., a `.md` file with a Mermaid block).",
      "step_5_rendering_and_publishing": "The final step involves rendering the diagram code into visual assets (e.g., SVG, PNG) and publishing them. For Mermaid code embedded in Markdown files, platforms like GitHub provide native, automatic rendering. For a more scalable and automated solution, a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is recommended. This pipeline would use CLI tools like `mermaid-cli` or `plantuml.jar` to render the diagrams, run validation and linting checks, and then publish the final assets. The entire project, including source documents, intermediate JSON, diagram code, and final rendered images, is published to a version-controlled repository for accessibility and transparency.",
      "orchestration_and_provenance": "The entire multi-step pipeline should be orchestrated using tools like GitHub Actions, Python scripts, or a Makefile to automate the flow from one step to the next. Ensuring provenance is critical for legal applications. This is achieved through multiple layers: 1) maintaining a clear data lineage through a well-organized directory structure (e.g., `.zzRef` for sources -> `RAWDATA` for text -> `Mermaid01` for diagrams), as seen in the `law-diagrams` project; 2) embedding explicit citations and article references directly within the diagram nodes to link them back to the source text; and 3) for maximum auditability, using formal standards like Akoma Ntoso to structure the source text and W3C PROV-O to create a detailed, machine-readable record of the entire generation and review process."
    },
    "llm_prompt_engineering_patterns": {
      "canonical_json_schema_summary": "To ensure a structured and reliable extraction process, a canonical JSON schema, influenced by legal informatics standards like LegalRuleML, is proposed. This schema serves as the target format for the first LLM step. Its key fields are designed to capture the nuances of legal text, including: `rule_id` (a unique identifier like 'Article 14'), `citation` (the precise source reference), `rule_type` (distinguishing between 'constitutive' rules that define concepts and 'prescriptive' rules that regulate actions), `actors` (the entities involved, e.g., 'The State'), `conditions` (prerequisites for the rule to apply), `actions` (the mandated or permitted activities, with a `normative_effect` like 'obligation', 'permission', or 'prohibition'), `exceptions` (clauses that override or modify the rule), and an `ambiguity_flag` with `ambiguity_notes` to explicitly mark sections that require human review.",
      "extraction_prompt_template": "A robust prompt for extracting legal logic into the canonical JSON format should be multi-faceted. It begins by assigning a specific role to the LLM, such as: 'As an expert legal NLP system, your task is to extract decision logic...'. It then provides clear, step-by-step instructions and includes the full target JSON schema directly within the prompt. To guide the model's output, a few-shot or one-shot example is provided, showing a sample of constitutional text and the corresponding, perfectly formatted JSON output. Finally, the prompt enforces strict output constraints, such as: 'Output ONLY the JSON block. Do not include any conversational text, explanations, or markdown formatting.' This combination of role-playing, schema definition, examples, and constraints significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the extraction.",
      "diagram_generation_prompt_template": "For converting the structured JSON into diagram code, a separate, deterministic prompt is used. This prompt template would instruct the LLM: 'You are an expert in Mermaid.js syntax. Convert the following JSON object, which represents legal logic from the Constitution of India, into a deterministic Mermaid diagram. You must adhere to the following strict rules: 1. The diagram must use a top-down layout (`graph TD`). 2. Use short, systematic alphanumeric node IDs (e.g., A1, B2). 3. Enclose all descriptive node labels in square brackets `[]`. 4. Use `-->` for all connections. 5. Group related concepts using `subgraph \"Title\" ... end`. 6. Apply visual styling using the provided `classDef` conventions. Your output must be ONLY the Mermaid code block, ready for rendering.' This highly constrained prompt ensures the generated code is consistent with the successful patterns of the `law-diagrams` project.",
      "verification_and_error_handling_prompts": "To improve accuracy, a multi-stage verification process is recommended. After the initial extraction, a 'Chain-of-Verification' or self-critique prompt can be used. This prompt asks the LLM to review its own generated JSON against the original source text and a checklist of criteria (completeness, accuracy, schema compliance) and provide a corrected version if necessary. If a programmatic validator detects a schema violation in the LLM's output, an 'Error Recovery' prompt is triggered. This prompt provides the LLM with the original text, the incorrect JSON it generated, and the specific validation error message (e.g., 'missing required field \"citation\"'), instructing it to fix the error and produce a valid output.",
      "key_guardrails": "To ensure reliable and consistent LLM output, several essential guardrails must be implemented. First, **Banned Tokens** and strict output formatting instructions are used to force the LLM to generate only the desired code or JSON, without any extraneous conversational text. Second, **Normalization Rules** are applied to standardize data, such as ensuring all legal citations follow a consistent format and that terminology adheres to the predefined enums in the schema (e.g., using 'permission' not 'Permitted'). Third, and most importantly, **Schema Adherence** is programmatically enforced by validating the LLM's output against the canonical JSON schema using a library like `Guardrails.ai` or a standard JSON schema validator. This acts as a critical quality gate, catching malformed outputs and triggering the error recovery process."
    },
    "text_chunking_and_context_strategies": {
      "recommended_chunking_strategy": "The optimal strategy for chunking a hierarchically structured and semantically dense document like the Constitution of India is a hybrid approach. The process should begin with **Structural Chunking**, which leverages the document's inherent organization by dividing the text along its natural boundaries (e.g., by Part, Article, and Clause). This preserves the logical and semantic integrity of each legal provision. For articles that are exceptionally long and exceed the LLM's context window, **Recursive Chunking** should then be applied. This method further subdivides the text while respecting sentence and paragraph boundaries, ensuring that meaning is not fragmented. This two-tiered approach combines the benefits of structural awareness with the necessity of manageable chunk sizes.",
      "comparison_of_strategies": "Different chunking methods present a trade-off between simplicity and contextual accuracy. **Fixed-Size Chunking** (e.g., splitting every 1024 tokens or 100 lines, as was done in the `law-diagrams` project) is simple to implement and scalable but carries a high risk of arbitrarily cutting sentences or logical rules, which is detrimental for legal text. **Semantic Chunking**, which groups text based on topical similarity, ensures high contextual relevance but is computationally intensive and requires careful tuning. **Structural Chunking** (by Article/Clause) is ideal for well-structured documents like the Constitution as it maintains the intended legal context, though it can result in chunks of highly variable sizes.",
      "cross_reference_handling": "The Constitution of India is replete with internal cross-references (e.g., 'as provided in Article 368') and definitions that are critical for correct interpretation. An effective strategy must handle these explicitly. Key techniques include: 1. **Automated Reference Resolution**: A pre-processing step to detect references and dynamically expand them by injecting the content of the referenced article into the current context. 2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Building a graph where nodes represent articles or legal concepts and edges represent relationships (e.g., 'refers to', 'amends', 'defines'). This graph can be queried during the retrieval step to provide the LLM with the necessary relational context. 3. **Metadata Tagging**: Enriching each text chunk with metadata that includes a list of cited articles and defined terms, enabling more sophisticated and accurate filtering during retrieval.",
      "rag_vs_long_context_models": "For querying and analyzing a large corpus like the Constitution, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy is demonstrably superior to simply feeding the entire document into a long-context model. While modern LLMs boast massive context windows (e.g., 1M+ tokens), they suffer from a 'lost-in-the-middle' problem, where their ability to recall and reason about information degrades for content buried deep within the context. Furthermore, processing such long contexts is computationally expensive and slow. RAG is more effective because it uses a targeted retrieval step to find a small number of highly relevant text chunks and presents only that focused information to the LLM. This approach leads to higher accuracy, lower costs, faster responses, and crucially, enables precise source citation, which is non-negotiable for legal applications."

      "taxonomy_of_legal_constructs": "A systematic classification of common legal drafting constructs found in the Constitution of India includes several key patterns that an LLM must identify to ensure accurate visualization. These are:\n\n*   **Proviso:** A clause, typically starting with 'provided that...', which is appended to a main provision to qualify or create an exception to it. Based on judicial interpretation (e.g., *S.Sundaram Pillai & Ors. v. V.R. Pattabiraman & Ors.*), a proviso can serve four distinct functions: 1) as an exception or qualification to the main rule, 2) as a mandatory condition for the main rule's application, 3) in rare cases, as a separate substantive provision, or 4) as an explanatory addendum to clarify intent. Modern drafting guides recommend replacing provisos with clearer exception clauses.\n\n*   **Non-Obstante Clause:** A provision beginning with 'Notwithstanding anything contained in...' which establishes the overriding effect of that clause over any other conflicting provisions. It signals legislative priority and ensures the provision's enforcement without hindrance.\n\n*   **'May' vs. 'Shall' (Discretionary vs. Mandatory):** The term 'Shall' indicates a mandatory duty or obligation (modern guidance suggests using 'must'). The term 'May' implies discretion or permission, although courts may interpret 'may' as mandatory if the statutory context suggests an obligatory intent.\n\n*   **'Subject to':** This phrase indicates subordination, meaning the provision it governs yields to the provision it is 'subject to' in case of a conflict.\n\n*   **Exception:** A clause that excludes specific cases from a general provision. Unlike a proviso, an exception is often more integrated into the main text, and the burden of proof for its applicability can differ.\n\n*   **Saving Provision:** A clause designed to preserve existing rights, remedies, or legal statuses from the effects of new or repealing legislation. Provisos are sometimes used to enact saving clauses.\n\n*   **Actors, Triggers, and Conditions:** These are fundamental rule components. **Actors** are the entities (e.g., President, citizen) empowered or obligated to act. **Triggers** are the events that activate a rule (e.g., 'Proclamation of Emergency'). **Conditions** are the specific criteria that must be met for a rule to apply.",
      "mapping_to_flowcharts": "Flowcharts are best for visualizing processes and procedures with sequential steps and simple binary decisions. The mapping from legal constructs to flowchart elements is as follows:\n\n*   **Condition/Trigger:** Represented as a diamond-shaped **Decision Node** with 'Yes' and 'No' exit paths.\n*   **Proviso (as an Exception):** Modeled as a conditional branch from the main process flow. The main path represents the general rule, and the branch represents the exception defined in the proviso.\n*   **Proviso (as a Substantive Rule):** Represented as a separate **Process Block** or a linked sub-flowchart to indicate it's a distinct rule.\n*   **Non-Obstante Clause:** Visually indicated with a **Note/Annotation** or a bolded, prioritized path that clearly shows it overrides or terminates conflicting paths.\n*   **'Shall' (Mandatory Action):** Represented as a rectangular **Process Block**, indicating a required action that must be taken.\n*   **'May' (Discretionary Action):** Modeled as a **Decision Node** where an actor can choose between two or more paths.\n*   **Actor:** Often represented using **Swimlanes**, where each lane is dedicated to an actor and shows all the actions they perform.\n*   **Cross-Reference:** Indicated with a **Connector** symbol that links to another part of the flowchart or to a separate diagram entirely, managing complexity.\n\nAn example use case is modeling the procedure for the President to promulgate an Ordinance (Article 123), which involves triggers, actors, and actions in a clear sequence.",

It separates decision logic from the process flow.\n\n*   **Condition/Trigger:** Mapped to an **Input Column** in the decision table, where the condition is evaluated for each rule row.\n*   **Proviso (as an Exception):** Represented as a specific **Rule Row** in the table. This row will have a unique input entry that leads to a different output, effectively modeling the exception.\n*   **Non-Obstante Clause:** This is not directly represented in the table's logic but informs the overall decision architecture. It determines which decision table takes precedence if multiple tables model conflicting rules.\n*   **'Shall' (Mandatory Outcome):** Represented as the **Output Entry** for a matched rule, defining the mandatory outcome.\n*   **'May' (Discretionary Outcome):** Can be modeled by having multiple rules with the same inputs but different outputs, allowing for a choice of outcomes.\n*   **Actor:** Can be an **Input Column** (e.g., 'Applicant Role') or part of the output description.\n\nAn example use case is modeling the suspension of Fundamental Rights under Article 359, where the inputs would be 'Type of Emergency' and 'Content of Presidential Order', and the output would be the 'List of Suspended Rights'.",
      "mapping_to_state_diagrams": "State diagrams are perfectly suited for modeling the lifecycle of a legal status or entity, showing how it transitions between different states in response to legal events (triggers). They are not for showing process but for visualizing changes in legal status over time.\n\n*   **States:** Represent the different legal statuses an entity can have. For example, the status of a Fundamental Right could be 'Fully Enforceable', 'Suspended', or 'Partially Enforceable'.\n*   **Transitions:** Represent the legal events or triggers that cause a change from one state to another. These are the arrows connecting the states.\n*   **Triggers:** The labels on the transitions that describe the event, such as 'Proclamation of Emergency under Art. 352' or 'Presidential Order under Art. 359'.\n\nAn ideal use case is visualizing the status of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency. The diagram would show the initial state ('Enforceable'), a transition to 'Article 19 Suspended' triggered by a proclamation under Article 358, and another potential transition to 'Specific Rights Unenforceable' triggered by a specific Presidential order under Article 359.",
      "readability_considerations": "To ensure the generated diagrams are clear, accurate, and do not impose an excessive cognitive load, several principles must be followed, drawing from both legal drafting guides like the SARAL Manual and practical project experience from the `law-diagrams` repository:\n\n*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** Use plain language and break down complex rules into single, understandable propositions. Avoid legal jargon where possible. The visual representation should not be more complex than the original text.\n*   **Accuracy vs. Simplicity Trade-off:** There is a critical balance to be struck. An overly simplistic diagram can be misleading and misrepresent legal obligations, while an overly complex one loses its purpose of clarification. The visualization must accurately represent the substance of the rule.\n*   **Context is Key:** Diagrams of isolated rules can be dangerous. They should always be supplemented with context, explanations, and direct links back to the full source text to prevent misunderstanding.\n*   **Visual Consistency:** Adhere to consistent layout and styling conventions. The `law-diagrams` project, for instance, mandates a vertical 'Top-Down' (`graph TD`) layout for mobile-friendliness, consistent color schemes for different constitutional topics, and clear subgraph titles.\n*   **Expert Oversight:** The process of converting legal text to diagrams is interpretive and difficult. The output from an LLM must be validated by a team of legal and design experts to ensure both legal accuracy and usability."

The recommended standards form a layered approach:\n\n*   **Akoma Ntoso (AKN):** This OASIS standard is for the machine-readable representation of legislative and judicial documents. It uses an XML vocabulary to meticulously encode the document's structure (Parts, Articles, Clauses, Provisos), metadata, and content. It serves as the foundational layer for capturing the structural hierarchy of the Constitution and managing its lifecycle, including amendments.\n\n*   **Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) Core:** This ontology provides a vocabulary for describing the *meaning* of the law. While AKN describes the document's structure, LKIF describes its semantics. It allows the model to capture abstract legal concepts like norms, actions, agents, and roles, and the relationships between them (e.g., which article defines a term or confers a right).\n\n*   **LegalRuleML:** This OASIS standard is designed specifically for representing and interchanging legal rules. It extends the general-purpose RuleML with features crucial for law, such as defeasible rules (rules with exceptions), temporal constraints, and deontic logic (obligations, permissions, prohibitions). It is critical for modeling the operational logic within an article. A key feature is **isomorphism**, which maintains a direct link between the formal rule and the specific natural language text in the source document, ensuring provenance and authoritativeness.",

This approach ensures consistency and avoids redundant data entry.\n\n*   **Mapping to Flowcharts and Relationship Graphs (Mermaid/Graphviz/PlantUML):** These tools are ideal for visualizing structure, processes, and relationships. A transformer script would parse the JSON data model:\n    *   The hierarchical structure of `parts` and `articles` would be used to generate organizational charts.\n    *   The `rules` array, with its `conditions` and `conclusion`, would be converted into flowchart decision nodes and process blocks.\n    *   The `crossReferences` array would be used to draw edges between article nodes, creating a graph that visualizes the web of dependencies across the Constitution.\n\n*   **Mapping to Decision Tables (DMN):** DMN is perfect for modeling complex, multi-conditional legal rules. A DMN transformer would map the `rules` array into a DMN decision table:\n    *   The `conditions` in the JSON would become the input columns of the DMN table.\n    *   The `conclusion` would become the output column.\n    *   The logic would be expressed using the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL), which is part of the DMN standard. This provides a clear, business-friendly, and potentially executable representation of the legal logic.",
      "versioning_and_provenance": "A robust strategy for versioning and provenance is critical for any legal application to ensure auditability, trust, and historical accuracy.\n\n*   **Versioning for Amendments:** The Constitution is a dynamic document. The data model must handle this by including an `amendments` array at the article or clause level. This array stores structured data about each change, including the type of change (e.g., 'Inserted', 'Substituted', 'Repealed'), the amending act, and the effective date. This detailed tracking allows the system to reconstruct the state of the Constitution at any given point in time, ensuring backward compatibility and enabling historical analysis.\n\n*   **Provenance Tracking:** The model includes a `provenance` block at the root to record the source of the text (e.g., `EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`), the tools used for extraction (e.g., a specific LLM version), and timestamps. For more granular and standardized provenance, the **W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O)** should be used. This allows for the creation of a detailed, machine-readable record of the entire data generation workflow, capturing what information was used, which activities transformed it, and which agents (automated or human) were involved, ensuring full auditability from source text to final diagram."

      "typology_of_constructs": "The Constitution of India employs several complex legal constructs that require careful modeling to avoid misrepresentation. A typology based on judicial interpretation includes:\n\n*   **Proviso:** A clause appended to a main provision, typically starting with 'Provided that...'. Its primary function is to qualify or carve out an exception from the main rule. However, it can sometimes act as a mandatory condition, a substantive provision, or a clarifying clause. Its interpretation is always tied to the clause it follows.\n\n*   **Exception:** A clause, often inline, that restrains the main provision by removing specific cases from its scope. The burden of proof for exceptions can differ from that for provisos.\n\n*   **Non-Obstante Clause:** A provision that begins with 'Notwithstanding anything contained in...' which gives it an overriding effect over any other conflicting provisions. It signals legislative intent to prioritize this rule, and its use reflects an awareness of potential conflicts that need to be preemptively resolved.\n\n*   **Saving Clause:** A provision designed to preserve existing rights, remedies, or legal statuses when a law is repealed or replaced. It often deals with transitional arrangements.\n\n*   **Multi-Party Decision Authority:** Constitutional processes that require sequential or parallel decisions by multiple actors (e.g., a bill passing through both houses of Parliament and then receiving Presidential assent). These involve conditional triggers and potential feedback loops (e.g., reconsideration of a bill).",
      "representation_patterns": "Specific patterns are required to model the precedence and logic of these complex constructs in different diagram types:\n\n**In Flowcharts:**\n*   **Provisos/Exceptions:** Modeled as conditional diamond nodes that branch off from the main process flow. The main path represents the general rule, while the branch represents the exception. Exceptions should be modeled as gating decisions *before* the general rule is applied.\n*   **Non-Obstante Clauses:** Must be represented as an override. This can be a visually distinct path (e.g., bolded or colored) that bypasses or terminates other conflicting branches, clearly signaling its preemptive power.\n*   **Multi-Party Authority:** Requires diverging and converging branches to represent sequential or parallel decision-making. Feedback loops with labeled arrows are critical to model processes like a bill being returned for reconsideration.\n\n**In DMN Decision Tables:**\n*   **Provisos/Exceptions:** Modeled as specific rule rows with conditions that, when met, lead to an exceptional outcome. These rules are often placed with higher priority in the table.\n*   **Non-Obstante Clauses:** Modeled as preemptive rules that appear at the top of the decision table. Their conditions are evaluated first, and if they match, their outcome is chosen, overriding any subsequent conflicting rules. The hit policy of the table (e.g., 'Priority' or 'First') is crucial for enforcing this precedence.",
      "visual_encoding_recommendations": "Visual cues are essential to clearly distinguish exceptions and overrides from general rules, reducing cognitive load for the viewer. Recommendations include:\n\n*   **Color and Shape:** Use a consistent color-coding scheme to differentiate rule types. For example, general rules could be in blue, exceptions in orange, and overriding non-obstante clauses in red. Different node shapes can also be used to signify different types of actions or decisions.\n\n*   **Priority Indicators:** For non-obstante clauses, use strong visual cues to signal their overriding status. This can include bolded arrows, thicker lines, or explicit text annotations like '⚡ OVERRIDES'.\n\n*   **Styling with Classes:** In tools like Mermaid, use the `classDef` feature to define styles for different categories of constitutional content. The `law-diagrams` project, for example, defines classes like `rights`, `duties`, and `governance` with specific fill and stroke colors, which are then applied to relevant nodes.\n\n*   **Layout and Flow:** The layout should visually reinforce the logic. Exceptions should branch off the main flow. Overriding paths should visibly cut across or preempt other paths. Hierarchical relationships should be shown with a clear top-down flow.\n\n*   **Legends:** Every set of diagrams must include a clear visual legend that explains the meaning of each color, shape, line style, and icon used. This is critical for ensuring the diagrams are interpreted correctly.",

Does the diagram accurately reflect the order of operations? Are overrides from non-obstante clauses correctly shown to preempt other rules?\n3.  **Visual Clarity:** Ensure that the visual encoding is clear and unambiguous. Does the diagram effectively communicate which rules are general and which are exceptions? Is the override logic immediately apparent?\n4.  **Completeness:** Confirm that all possible paths, conditions, and outcomes described in the text are represented in the diagram. For multi-party decisions, ensure all feedback loops and finality points are mapped.\n5.  **Source Grounding:** Cross-reference every major element in the diagram back to the authoritative source text and, where applicable, to relevant judicial interpretations or landmark cases to ensure fidelity.\n6.  **Contextual Annotations:** Check that the diagram is supplemented with necessary annotations, citations, and links to the full text to provide context and prevent misinterpretation."

For DMN, a two-pronged approach is used: `dmn-check` performs static analysis on the XML to find logical bugs (like inconsistent rules), while `dmnlint` can be integrated into editors for real-time feedback. For Graphviz DOT files, a suite of command-line tools provides deeper semantic analysis beyond basic syntax: `sccmap` detects cycles, `acyclic` enforces acyclic graph structures, `ccomps` finds unreachable nodes, and `gvpr` allows for custom validation scripts. For PlantUML, the `-checkonly` and `-syntax` flags provide fast, scriptable syntax validation without generating images, making them ideal for quick CI checks.

The key feature of LegalRuleML is its support for 'isomorphism,' which maintains a direct, one-to-one link between a formal rule and the specific natural language text it represents in the Akoma Ntoso document. This creates an unbreakable chain of provenance. For practical implementation, the W3C Web Annotation Data Model is used to create precise citation spans (e.g., using XPath selectors) that can pinpoint the exact source text corresponding to a node or edge in a diagram. The entire validation and generation process is tracked using the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O) to create a complete, auditable record of every transformation and agent involved.",

Recall measures what percentage of all actual conditions present in the text were successfully identified by the LLM. 3) **Hallucination Rate / Citation Coverage:** Calculated as the percentage of generated rules or diagram elements that lack a valid, verifiable citation link back to a specific part of the source text. A low hallucination rate is critical for establishing trust in the system's output. 4) **Content Accuracy (e.g., Multiset Jaccard Similarity):** This metric compares the set of elements (nodes, edges, conditions) in the generated diagram against a human-annotated ground truth to measure the factual correctness of the content."

While true readability is subjective, certain heuristics correlate well with cognitive load. Key metrics include: 1) **Average Label Length:** Calculated by parsing all node labels and averaging the number of words or characters. Shorter, more concise labels generally improve readability. 2) **Proxies for Edge Crossings:** While true edge crossing is a rendering property, structural analysis can provide proxies. For example, counting the number of high-degree nodes (nodes with many incoming/outgoing connections) can indicate areas of high visual clutter that are likely to result in tangled, hard-to-read diagrams.",

The workflow would include several quality gates: 1) **Validity Gate:** The build fails if any diagram's source code does not compile (e.g., using `mermaid-cli`). This is the most basic check. 2) **Complexity Gate:** The pipeline calculates structural metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, node count). If these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., cyclomatic complexity > 20), the build fails or issues a warning, flagging the diagram for review as potentially too complex. 3) **Readability Gate:** The pipeline calculates readability metrics. If the average label length is too high or there are too many high-degree nodes, a warning is issued.

It can be rendered on a static site via a CDN. However, its native interactivity is limited; while nodes can have URL links, adding click events requires setting a 'loose' security level, and linking from edges is not natively supported, necessitating complex JavaScript workarounds. 2) **Cytoscape.js**: A powerful, open-source graph theory library optimized for rich, interactive network visualizations. It is an excellent choice for a custom Single-Page Application (SPA), offering built-in mobile gestures (pinch-to-zoom), a vast plugin ecosystem for features like context menus and search, and a robust event model for custom interactions. It is highly performant and has no external dependencies. 3) **D3.js**: A highly flexible library for creating completely custom, data-driven visualizations. It offers granular control over SVG and CSS, making it ideal for unique, dynamic interfaces with animations. However, it has a steep learning curve and requires significant code for basic effects. 4) **d3-graphviz**: This library combines D3.js's rendering power with Graphviz's layout engine, using WebAssembly for high performance. It excels at creating animated transitions between graph states. 5) **React Flow & Elk.js**: A declarative React component library for building node-based diagrams, which, when paired with the Elk.js layout engine, provides a powerful framework for creating custom interactive diagrams within a React application. 6) **High-Performance WebGL Libraries**: For extremely large graphs (over 50,000 nodes), WebGL-based libraries like **Sigma.js**, **Ogma** (commercial), or **yFiles** (commercial) offer the best performance, though they represent a significant increase in development complexity and potential cost.",

This is essential for sharing and citation. 2) **Cross-Diagram Linking**: Given the 39 modular diagrams in the `law-diagrams` project, a critical feature is the ability to navigate between them. Clicking on a node representing a related concept (e.g., a reference to another Part) should seamlessly load the corresponding diagram. 3) **Source Text Anchoring**: Each node or element in a diagram should be hyperlinked to the precise article, clause, or line number in the source text of the Constitution (`EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`). This provides immediate context and allows for verification. 4) **Search**: A powerful client-side search functionality is needed. This should use a lightweight library like FlexSearch or MiniSearch to allow users to search the full text of the Constitution. 5) **Filtering and Highlighting**: The viewer must allow users to filter the graph to reduce visual clutter and highlight specific nodes or paths based on search queries or user selections. For example, searching for 'President' should highlight all nodes related to the President's powers and duties.

The deployment plan should leverage modern, efficient web hosting solutions. 1) **Performance Optimization Techniques**: To ensure a smooth user experience, several techniques should be employed: a) **Level of Detail (LoD)**: Simplify graphs when zoomed out (e.g., by clustering nodes) and render more detail when zoomed in. b) **Web Workers**: Offload computationally intensive tasks, such as graph layout calculations, to a background thread to keep the main UI thread responsive. c) **Virtualization**: Only render the elements currently within the user's viewport. d) **WebGL Rendering**: For the largest and most complex diagrams, using a WebGL-based library like Sigma.js or Ogma will provide the highest performance. e) **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Using libraries like `d3-graphviz` that leverage WASM for layout calculations can provide near-native speed. 2) **Deployment Plan**: The application should be deployed on a static hosting platform like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These platforms offer seamless integration with Git, automated CI/CD pipelines, and global content delivery networks (CDNs). A CI/CD pipeline should be configured to automatically build, test, and deploy the viewer whenever changes are pushed to the main repository branch, ensuring the live version is always up-to-date. Standard web performance practices like asset minification, code-splitting, and service worker caching should also be implemented."
    },
    "maintenance_and_update_strategy": {
      "monitoring_sources": "To ensure the diagrams remain current, a systematic monitoring of official government sources is required. Since these sources lack programmatic notification mechanisms like RSS feeds or APIs, periodic manual or scripted checks are necessary. The primary sources to monitor are: 1) **Legislative Department (legislative.gov.in)**: This is the most authoritative source for the final text of all Constitution Amendment Acts, providing downloadable PDFs of the legal changes. 2) **The eGazette of India (egazette.gov.in)**: This is the official gazette where all acts, including constitutional amendments, are formally published and come into force. It also provides early insight by publishing Amendment Bills before they become law. 3) **IndiaCode (indiacode.nic.in)**: This platform provides the updated, consolidated text of the Constitution after amendments have been incorporated. For example, it hosts 'THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [As on 1st May, 2024]', which incorporates changes up to the 106th Amendment. 4) **PRS Legislative Research (prsindia.org)**: A valuable secondary source that tracks and provides analysis of legislative developments, including Constitutional Amendment Bills, offering context and summaries of proposed changes.",
      "update_pipeline": "An automated pipeline is essential for efficiently incorporating amendments. This pipeline should be implemented using a CI/CD system like GitHub Actions and would consist of several stages: 1) **Diff Analysis**: Once a new amendment is identified, a textual 'diff' is performed between the newly consolidated Constitution text and the project's existing source file (`RAWDATA/EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`). This identifies the specific articles and clauses that have been added, varied, or repealed. 2) **Impact Mapping**: The identified changes are mapped to the 39 Mermaid diagrams to determine which ones are affected. This includes analyzing cross-references to understand any cascading impacts. 3) **Automated Regeneration**: The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by an update to the source text file. It automatically runs a script (e.g., using `mermaid-cli`) to regenerate the affected diagrams. 4) **Regression Testing**: To ensure quality, the pipeline must include automated tests. This involves **syntactic validation** to ensure the new Mermaid code is valid and **visual regression testing**, which uses tools to create a visual 'diff' comparing the newly rendered diagrams against the last known-good versions, flagging any unintended visual changes for review.",
      "versioning_and_archiving": "A clear versioning and archival strategy is crucial for tracking the evolution of the law and providing historical context. 1) **Version Tagging**: The project should use Git tags to create immutable snapshots of the repository. A semantic versioning scheme based on the latest incorporated amendment is recommended (e.g., `v106-2023` for the version including the 106th Amendment). 2) **Changelog**: A `CHANGELOG.md` file must be maintained in the root of the repository. For each new version, an entry should be added detailing the official name and number of the amendment, its effective date, and a summary of the changes made to the diagrams and source text. 3) **Archived Views**: To allow users to access historical versions, the Git tags serve as the primary mechanism. Users can check out a specific tag (e.g., `git checkout v105-2019`) to see the state of the diagrams at that point in time. For greater accessibility, a dedicated 'Archive' section can be created on the project's website, providing direct links to view or download the diagrams corresponding to each major version of the Constitution.",
      "governance_workflow": "A structured workflow with defined roles ensures that updates are managed accurately and efficiently. For an open-source project, these roles can be filled by a core team or community contributors. The proposed workflow is as follows: 1) **Roles**: a) **Monitor**: Responsible for regularly checking official sources for new amendments. b) **Analyst**: Performs the diff and impact analysis and updates the source text file. c) **Developer/Maintainer**: Manages the CI/CD pipeline and technical infrastructure. d) **Legal Reviewer**: A subject-matter expert who verifies the legal accuracy of the changes. 2) **Workflow Steps**: a) The **Monitor** detects a new amendment and opens an issue on GitHub. b) The **Analyst** acquires the official text, performs the analysis, and submits a pull request with the updated source data. c) The pull request automatically triggers the **CI/CD pipeline**, which regenerates diagrams and runs tests, posting the results back to the PR. d) The **Legal Reviewer** and **Maintainer** review the pull request, including the textual changes and the visual diffs of the diagrams. e) Once approved, the pull request is merged, and the **Maintainer** creates a new version tag and updates the changelog, publishing the release."
    },
    "multilingual_integration_strategy": {
      "text_extraction_and_alignment": "The foundation for multilingual support is the creation of a parallel corpus of English and Hindi text. The project's source PDF (`EnglishCOI_20240716890312078.pdf`) is a diglot edition containing both languages. The first step is to perform a clean extraction of the Hindi text. This can be done using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. Tesseract OCR, with its Hindi language pack (`tesseract-ocr-hin`), is a strong open-source option, while Google Cloud Vision offers a powerful commercial alternative. For alignment, a heuristic approach based on the Constitution's structure is most practical. The Hindi text can be aligned with the existing English text (`RAWDATA/EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`) by matching the corresponding Part, Article, and Schedule numbers, which serve as unique identifiers. For more granular sentence-level alignment, NLP tools like `hunalign` or `LF Aligner` can be employed to create a precise parallel corpus.",
      "rendering_and_font_issues": "A significant technical challenge is rendering Indic scripts like Devanagari (for Hindi) in Mermaid diagrams, especially on platforms like GitHub. Mermaid.js has known issues with non-English character sets that can cause parsing errors and break diagrams. The following solutions are necessary: 1) **Syntax Workaround**: All Hindi text within the Mermaid code, such as node labels, must be enclosed in double quotes (`\"\"`) to prevent the parser from misinterpreting the characters. 2) **Font Support**: Correct rendering is critically dependent on the availability of a suitable font. A comprehensive font like **Noto Sans Devanagari** must be used. When rendering diagrams via a CLI tool like `mermaid-cli`, the Puppeteer configuration must be explicitly updated to include the path to this font file. 3) **Unicode Normalization**: Applying Unicode normalization (e.g., NFC) to the text before passing it to Mermaid can help prevent inconsistencies in character encoding that lead to rendering failures.",
      "risk_mitigation_for_translation": "Translating legal text carries a high risk of 'semantic drift,' where subtle changes in wording alter the legal meaning. This risk cannot be managed by automated tools alone. A multi-layered mitigation strategy is essential: 1) **Automated Quality Checks**: Use automated metrics like BLEU, chrF, and COMET to get a baseline score of translation quality. Back-translation (translating from Hindi back to English and comparing with the original) can also help identify major discrepancies. 2) **Bilingual Legal Glossary**: Augment translation prompts for LLMs with a curated glossary of key English-Hindi legal terms to ensure consistency and accuracy for critical terminology. 3) **Mandatory Human-in-the-Loop Review**: This is the most critical step. All translated diagrams and text must be reviewed and validated by bilingual legal experts. This human oversight is non-negotiable to ensure the legal accuracy and validity of the multilingual content. Automated methods can assist, but cannot replace, expert legal judgment.",
      "cross_lingual_search_and_filtering": "To make the multilingual repository fully functional, users must be able to search for content in either English or Hindi. This requires a sophisticated search implementation: 1) **Cross-Lingual Retrieval**: The search system should be built on multilingual embeddings, such as LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embeddings). This technology allows a user to enter a query in one language (e.g., English) and retrieve relevant documents and diagrams in another (e.g., Hindi), by understanding the semantic meaning of the query across languages. 2) **Language-Specific Indexing**: The search backend (e.g., Elasticsearch) must be configured with a dedicated Hindi language analyzer. This ensures that the search engine correctly handles Hindi word segmentation (tokenization), stemming, and stop words, leading to much more accurate and relevant search results for queries in Hindi. 3) **Transliteration Support**: To enhance user experience, the search should support transliteration, allowing users to search for Hindi terms using Latin characters (e.g., searching for 'samvidhan' to find 'संविधान')."

    "governance_and_licensing_considerations": {
      "copyright_status_of_source_text": "The text of the Constitution of India is not in the public domain. Under the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, it is classified as a 'Government work' (Section 2(k)), with the copyright held by the Government of India (Section 17(d)). However, Section 52(1)(q)(ii) of the Act provides a critical exception, permitting the reproduction or publication of any 'Act of a Legislature' on the condition that it is 'reproduced or published together with any commentary thereon or any other original matter.' Therefore, simply publishing the diagrams as a 'bare Act' visualization could be a copyright violation. To ensure compliance, the project must present the diagrams as 'original matter' or accompany them with explicit commentary and analysis, thereby satisfying the condition of the exception.",
      "tool_and_llm_licensing": "The project must adhere to the licenses of all software used. For example, Mermaid.js is typically under the permissive MIT license. Graphviz uses the business-friendly but copyleft-related Eclipse Public License (EPL). PlantUML is often under the GNU General Public License (GPL), a strong copyleft license that could require the entire project to be licensed as GPL if its output is considered a derivative work. A thorough audit of all tool licenses is required. Furthermore, if using LLMs, there is a critical distinction between cloud-based services and self-hosted models. Sending the constitutional text to a third-party cloud LLM poses significant data privacy risks, as the data could be stored or used for training. For legal documents, the recommended approach is to use a self-hosted, open-source LLM to maintain full control and privacy over the data.",
      "required_attribution_and_disclaimers": "To comply with copyright and manage liability, two elements are non-negotiable. First, clear and prominent attribution must be given to the Government of India (e.g., Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice) as the source of the constitutional text. Second, a comprehensive disclaimer must be displayed on the project's main page, stating that: 1) The diagrams are for educational and informational purposes only. 2) They do not constitute legal advice. 3) They are an interpretation and may contain errors or omissions. 4) For any legal purpose, users must refer to the official, authenticated version of the Constitution of India.",
      "governance_and_review_process": "A formal governance and review process should be implemented to ensure quality and compliance. This can be effectively managed using GitHub's features. The project should create standardized templates for Issues and Pull Requests. These templates should include a mandatory checklist for contributors, requiring them to: 1) Confirm the source of the legal text used. 2) Verify that sufficient commentary or original matter is included to comply with copyright. 3) Perform a self-review for accuracy against the source text. 4) Acknowledge that the submission will be reviewed by a project maintainer or legal expert before being merged. This creates a structured, auditable workflow for all contributions."
    },
    "creative_enhancement_opportunities": {
      "dmn_decision_tables": "To move beyond static flowcharts and represent complex legal logic with higher precision, **Decision Model and Notation (DMN)** should be used. DMN is an industry standard for modeling repeatable, rule-based decisions in a clear, tabular format that is both human-readable and machine-executable. It is ideal for modeling constitutional articles with complex eligibility tests, qualifications, or procedural requirements. For example, the qualifications for the President (Article 58) can be modeled as a DMN decision table with inputs like `isCitizenOfIndia`, `age`, and `holdsOfficeOfProfit`, and rules that determine the final 'Eligibility' outcome. Other prime candidates for DMN modeling include disqualification criteria for MPs (Art. 102), the procedure for impeaching the President (Art. 61), and the criteria for declaring an emergency (Art. 352). These DMN models can be exported as standard XML, making the logic interoperable and executable in compliant decision engines like Drools.",
      "interactive_scenario_simulators": "To transform the diagrams from descriptive tools into predictive ones, interactive scenario simulators can be developed. These would allow users to input a specific situation and see how constitutional rules apply to them. This can be achieved using specialized legal expert system frameworks: 1) **OpenFisca**: An open-source policy microsimulation engine, typically used for tax law, that can be adapted for constitutional scenarios. A user could input facts (e.g., age, citizenship, offices held), and the system would walk through the relevant articles to determine an outcome (e.g., eligibility for office). 2) **Catala**: A programming language designed specifically for translating law into executable code with a high degree of fidelity to the original text. Using Catala, one could build a validated model of constitutional procedures that allows users to simulate 'what-if' scenarios, providing a dynamic way to understand the practical application of the law.",
      "graph_based_q_and_a_system": "To enable users to ask natural language questions about the Constitution, a sophisticated Question-and-Answer system can be created using a **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach. This involves converting the structural information from the 39 Mermaid diagrams and the logical rules from the DMN tables into a knowledge graph. In this graph, nodes would represent entities (e.g., 'President', 'Parliament'), concepts (e.g., 'Fundamental Right'), and rules (e.g., 'Article 14'), while edges would represent their relationships (e.g., 'appoints', 'is bound by'). When a user asks a hypothetical question like, 'Can a 30-year-old citizen be appointed as a Supreme Court judge?', the system would first query this graph to retrieve the relevant rules and facts (e.g., from Article 124) before using an LLM to synthesize a precise, evidence-based natural language answer. A critical feature of such a system is traceability, ensuring every answer cites the specific constitutional provision it is based on.",
      "validation_and_risk_management": "Implementing executable models of law carries significant risks of oversimplification and misinterpretation, which must be proactively managed. 1) **Expert-Led Validation**: Any executable model (DMN, Catala, etc.) must be rigorously validated through **case-based testing**. This involves legal experts creating a comprehensive suite of test cases, including both common and edge-case scenarios, and manually determining the correct legal outcome. The system's output is then compared against this expert-verified ground truth to identify and correct any logical errors. 2) **Transparency and Explainability**: Systems that provide automated legal determinations must be transparent. They should be able to explain *how* they reached a conclusion for a specific case, citing the exact rules and data used. This is crucial for auditing and accountability. 3) **Right to Human Review**: Given that automated legal decisions can have significant real-world consequences, any system must include a clear and accessible mechanism for users to request a human review of an automated outcome. This aligns with legal principles like Article 22 of GDPR and is a fundamental safeguard against algorithmic error."

      "reasoning": "To address the field value that describes a canonical JSON schema for extracting constitutional decision logic, the most directly relevant content is guidance on enforcing structure via JSON Schema and constrained decoding. This includes explicit discussion of JSON Schema as a target structure and techniques to ensure the model outputs conform to a predefined schema, which aligns with the idea of a canonical JSON schema and its enforcement in prompts. Citations that discuss structured outputs and the use of JSON schemas in benchmarking and prompt design further support constructing a robust prompt that yields predictable, machine-parseable results, which is exactly what the field value prescribes. Additional excerpts emphasize the importance of a multi-stage prompt design (role-based prompts, few-shot examples) and a separate diagram-generation step that can take a structured JSON input and produce a diagram, which matches the described workflow from extraction to visualization. These sources together provide concrete, actionable methods for building prompts, enforcing schema compliance, and validating structured outputs in the constitution-related context. The most relevant parts include: a) a discussion of JSON Schema as the anchor for structured outputs and the use of constrained decoding to enforce schema compliance, b) benchmarking and evaluation resources that measure structured output quality (JSONSchemaBench), c) explicit notes on prompt design strategies that guide models toward producing well-formed JSON, d) the concept of converting structured outputs into diagrams, which maps to the diagram generation step implied by the canonical field value, and e) examples of how to build prompts that embed the schema and examples to guide the model toward correct formatting. The cited items collectively substantiate the approach described in the finegrained field value and illustrate concrete templates and workflows for achieving reliable, schema-compliant outputs from LLMs in a legal/constitutional setting.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value centers on governance and licensing considerations for using the Constitution text and visualization tools. Direct passages establish the legal status of Government works in India, which directly informs licensing and reuse decisions: whether the Constitution text is in the public domain or remains a government work, and who holds copyright. Specific references explain that government works in India are owned/held by the government and that Section 52(1)(q) carves exceptions for reproducing Acts of Legislatures if accompanied by commentary or original material, which is critical for compliance when creating diagrams. Additional cited excerpts enumerate the exact text of Section 52(1) and its subsections, clarifying what is allowed and what requires enabling commentary to fall within the exception. Other excerpts discuss Notwithstanding and related provisos, which frame how such exceptions interact with other statutory provisions, tightening or clarifying the scope of permissible use. There are also entries detailing the broader copyright landscape for government works, including the requirement to attribute to the government and to surface disclaimers, which map directly to governance and review processes. The collection of excerpts therefore supports the claim that: (a) the Constitution text’s copyright status is governed by government-work rules and specific statutory exceptions; (b) any visualization output must address copyright/compliance constraints (e.g., accompanying commentary) to stay within the allowed use; (c) licensing considerations for the visualization tools themselves (Mermaid, Graphviz, PlantUML) and for LLM-assisted processing are part of governance, including privacy, hosting choice, and attribution/disclaimer requirements. The most directly relevant passages describe government-work status and the exact statutory exemption (the need to pair reproduction with commentary or original matter), followed by explicit sections of the copyright act enumerating what is allowed and what requires commentary, and finally related governance/hosting implications. The remaining excerpts provide context about broader legal doctrinal phrases (provisos and non-obstante clauses) and general licensing discussions, which supplement the core point but are less directly probative than the statute-level provisions themselves.",

Excerpts that name Akoma Ntoso (AKN) as a machine-readable standard for legislative documents provide direct support for the structural layer of the model, including how Parts, Articles, and Clauses are encoded and how amendments are tracked. Excerpts that name LKIF Core as the semantic vocabulary—capturing concepts like norms, actions, agents, time, and the relationships among them—support the semantic layer of the model, tying document content to meaning beyond mere structure. Excerpts that introduce LegalRuleML as the standard for representing and exchanging legal rules—with features like defeasibility, time, deontic operators, and isomorphism linking rules to their textual sources—map to the procedural/operational layer that can express article-level logic and rules. Together, these excerpts reinforce a layered schema that combines document structure (AKN), semantics (LKIF), and rules (LegalRuleML), with provenance captured via isomorphism between rules and the source text. Additional excerpts discuss provenance in the context of PROV-O (the provenance ontology) and general notions of versioning and amendments, which align with the schema’s provenance and amendment-tracking components. The excerpts also touch on how such a model could be mapped to diagrams (Mermaid/DMN) as downstream representations, illustrating the multi-backend mapping strategy described in the proposed schema. Direct references to AKN and LKIF anchor the structural/semantic layers, while LegalRuleML anchors the rules layer and its isomorphic provenance mechanism. The PROV-O excerpts provide a concrete provenance framework that complements the isomorphism concept, reinforcing trust and auditable lineage for the layered model. Collectively, these excerpts substantiate each component of the fine-grained field value and its intended schema integration.",

Direct evidence shows a multi-tool approach for Mermaid diagrams: using mermaid-cli to render and validate syntax, supplemented by a CLI-based validation workflow and a validation script that enforces correct Mermaid structure before deployment. Statements like “mermaid-cli … generates an SVG output” and “validation script and procedures” indicate an automated validation workflow that can be integrated into CI. The DMN and GraphViz sections point to additional automated validation layers beyond Mermaid, including DMN-specific validators (dmn-check, dmnlint) and GraphViz tooling (sccmap, acyclic, ccomps, gvpr) for semantic checks, which aligns with a multi-tool validation strategy across diagram types. References to constrained decoding and JSON-schema-based validation demonstrate how automated validation can enforce structured outputs and provenance, tying into the broader need for auditable, ground-truth-backed diagrams that map to source texts. Taken together, these excerpts justify a multi-tool automated validation strategy that validates syntax (via rendering/execution-time checks), structural integrity (via dedicated validators and lint tools), and structured outputs (via JSON schema/constrained decoding) to support reliable, auditable diagram generation workflows. The strategy also envisions containerization for consistent environments, aligning with CI/CD practices. This combination matches the field value’s emphasis on an automated validation strategy spanning syntax validation, semantic checks, and structured-output enforcement across Mermaid, DMN, Graphviz, and PlantUML domains, with grounding and provenance.",

Instead of relying on fixed rules or vector-based similarity scores, the LLM processes the document and generates semantically coherent chunks, often also adding additional context, summaries, or other informat",
            "Document-Based Chunking [​]( \"Direct link to Document-Based Chunking\")\n\nDocument-based chunking uses the **intrinsic structure of a document** . Instead of relying on generic separators, it parses the document based on its format-specific elements. For example:\n\n* **Markdown** : Split by headings ( `#` , `##` ) to capture sections or subsections. * **HTML** : Split by tags ( `<p>` , `<div>` ) to preserve logical content blocks. * **PDF** : After preprocessing (e.g., OCR or conversion to Markdown), split by headers, paragraphs, tables, or other structural elements. * **Programming Code** : Split by functions or classes (e.g., `def` in Python) to maintain logical units of code. With this method, chunks stay aligned with the document’s logical organization, which often also correlates with semantic meaning as well."

      "reasoning": "- The strongest support identifies three core chunking strategies that are highly relevant for legal text: a fixed-size approach for predictability and scalability, a semantic approach that groups text by meaning and topical similarity, and a structure-aware (often called recursive or article/section-based) approach that respects the document’s inherent organization (e.g., by articles and sections). This directly aligns with the recommended strategy to combine structural chunking with recursive subdivision when needed, ensuring both logical integrity and manageable chunk sizes. It also underpins the idea that for long articles, recursion and sentence/paragraph boundaries help avoid fragmenting legal meaning. - The material specifically notes that for large, well-structured documents like constitutions, structure-aware chunking by article/section is ideal, with recursion used for exceptionally long articles to maintain meaning while keeping chunks within context limits. This supports the field value’s emphasis on preserving legal context and structural semantics in chunking. - There is explicit discussion of LLM-based or AI-driven chunking that can decide boundaries semantically or structurally, which reinforces the field value’s stance on using intelligent, context-aware chunking rather than purely fixed-size splits. It also covers practical trade-offs and the need to balance semantic cohesion with token/window constraints. - Several excerpts describe RAG-driven chunking (retrieval-augmented generation) and how chunk selection affects retrieval relevance, which connects to the cross_reference_handling and RG aspects in the field value. They explain how chunking strategy influences the effectiveness of retrieval, the need to preserve cross-document references, and the potential benefits of combining retrieval with structured outputs. - The cross_reference_handling portion of the field value is echoed in discussions about preserving context across references (e.g., articles referenced within constitutional text) and using metadata or knowledge-graphs to support retrieval. The excerpts highlight automated reference resolution and metadata tagging as mechanisms to maintain fidelity when chunks contain cross-references. - Finally, the comparison between RAG with long-context models and structured, chunked retrieval supports the field value’s “rag_vs_long_context_models” emphasis, arguing that structured chunking plus retrieval typically yields higher accuracy and better scalability than feeding a very long document into a single long-context model.",

This directly underpins the recommended approach of using an existing, complete diagram corpus as the starting point rather than building from scratch. Content showing that the project has 39 Mermaid diagrams and a master index confirms the viability of reuse and a roadmap for integration into a new workflow. It also documents the file organization (Mermaid01 directory, RAWDATA, .zzRef) which is essential for locating source text and diagram content to base new decision-flows on. Licensing-related cautions are supported by excerpts that note the absence of a license file in the repo, prompting due diligence and potential direct contact to confirm reuse rights; this directly informs the contingency plan to verify licensing before reuse. The presence of a README with project status, and a concrete “Complete Navigation Map” and “User Journeys” offers practical templates for how to structure prompts and outputs when building your own diagrams, which aligns with the desired two-tier plan: reuse existing diagrams (as few-shot exemplars) and then extend or tailor flows using the RAWDATA text. Additional value comes from the mermaid-design-patterns material, which helps craft effective diagram constructions and layout conventions (Pattern: Branching Rights, Process Flow, Sequential Articles), providing concrete prompt-patterns that can be embedded in LLM prompts to generate coherent, structured Mermaid definitions while keeping layout consistent with the established patterns. The materials describing the mermaid syntax guide, best practices, and the troubleshooting/docs ensure you can reliably render and validate diagrams, and thus form the practical backbone of the prompts you’ll craft for diagram generation. The RAWDATA/EnglishCOI text excerpts supply the raw constitution content that can be aligned to the diagrams, ensuring content fidelity when constructing new flows. The combination of status, structure, and design-pattern guidance supports a plan that starts from the completed Mermaid diagrams, uses them as exemplars, verifies licensing, and then proceeds with a principled, pattern-driven diagramming workflow.",

      "reasoning": "Direct references to structured outputs and constraint-based generation strongly align with the diagram_quality_metrics field. The most relevant excerpts describe explicit mechanisms to produce and validate structured outputs (JSON) for diagrams, which ties to the structural_metrics and readablity/readability aspects, as well as to fidelity when comparing diagram content against source material. Specifically, the excerpts discuss: (a) using a JSON-like or schema-driven approach to generate diagram data, which maps to structural_metrics by enforcing a defined shape and fields; (b) constrained decoding and JSON schema enforcement as means to ensure valid, well-formed diagram representations, which supports both structural_metrics and fidelity/readability through a predictable, machine-checkable format; (c) benchmarking and testing of structured outputs (JSONSchemaBench) to evaluate how faithfully the diagram data matches the intended schema, which informs fidelity metrics; and (d) validation scripts and CI-style quality gates that enforce correctness before diagrams are accepted, aligning with the ci_integration_plan portion of the field. The following excerpts provide concrete, targeted guidance: one excerpt lays out that structured outputs are governed by JSON schema and constrained decoding, and that JSON schema benchmarks (JSONSchemaBench) exist to evaluate how well models adhere to a schema, which directly supports the fidelity and structure aspects of the field value; another excerpt discusses using guided JSON generation and the need for outputs to be valid JSON, reinforcing the structural and readability goals through strict formatting. Additional excerpts present explicit validation tooling (Mermaid Validation Script) and general best practices around enforcing structure and correctness in diagram definitions, which maps to the CI integration plan portion. The combination of these sources gives a coherent picture of how to quantify and enforce diagram quality along the three axes described, and how to integrate those checks into automated pipelines. The most direct support comes from statements about JSON-schema-constrained outputs and JSON-schema benchmarks, followed by references to validation scripts and CI-like quality gates, then wider discussions of structured output generation and fidelity benchmarks. The extracted connections are grounded in the exact claims about structure, fidelity, readability, and automated validation as they pertain to diagram representations derived from legal texts.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value describes a taxonomy of drafting constructs and explicit guidance on how they function and map to visual diagrams. Several excerpts provide direct definitions and functional roles that align with this taxonomy. Specifically, notes on the proviso explain that it is a clause added to a main provision and can serve as an exception, a conditioning qualifier, or even a substantive provision, with modern drafting guidance suggesting clearer alternatives. This establishes the core taxonomy and its potential visual representation as branching exceptions or conditional flows in diagrams. Additional excerpts articulate that a non-obstante clause asserts overriding effect over conflicting provisions, which directly informs how such constructs are depicted as priority paths or override notes in diagrams. Further, multiple sources discuss the functional roles of markers like 'may' versus 'shall' (discretion vs. mandatory) and the notion of saving provisions, all of which map cleanly to diagrammatic modeling decisions (decision nodes, mandatory boxes, saving branches, and precedence notes). Other excerpts elaborate on the general purposes of provisos (e.g., four functional roles) and the broader interpretive framework around non-obstante clauses, which reinforces the mapping decisions (when to treat a proviso as an exception, when as a separate rule, and how overruling provisions interact with the base text). Taken together, these excerpts directly support the field value’s components and offer concrete guidance for translating the textual drafting devices into diagrammatic representations, such as flowcharts that depict exceptions, branches for conditional application, and priority paths for overriding provisions. The strongest support comes from passages that enumerate the exact functions of provisos and non-obstante clauses, followed by passages that describe the discretionary vs. mandatory language and saving provisions, which further refine how to encode these elements in diagrams. The combination of these sources provides coherent, multi-faceted guidance for mapping taxonomy to diagram structures, with sufficient authority and cross-reference to support the field value claims.",

These points directly inform prompts that generate valid Mermaid definitions and the need for proper scaffolding in prompts to ensure correct rendering. - Additional Mermaid CLI references show how to convert Mermaid syntax into diagrams from the command line, which informs prompt engineering for automated diagram generation pipelines, including how to handle file I/O and rendering in a reproducible manner. - Several excerpts discuss Mermaid live editors and online resources, which support the idea of iterative prompting and validation loops where the LL model can generate Mermaid code, which is then visually rendered and checked. - The presence of D2 (Declarative Diagramming) as a modern alternative with statements about its LLMM friendliness and autoformatter provides a basis for a tool-comparison in prompts: Mermaid is easy to learn and integrate; D2 is highlighted as highly LLMM-friendly due to autoformatting and clearer error messaging. This supports a structured recommendation to prefer Mermaid for rapid diagramming in a constitution-focused context, with D2 as a strong alternative when considering LL prompting efficiency and error handling. - The excerpts also reference broader diagram tooling (Graphviz, PlantUML, Cytoscape) to frame the Mermaid vs. alternatives decision, contextualizing where Mermaid fits in a diagram-as-code workflow for law diagrams and ensuring prompts target the right output language and structure. - Overall, the strongest, most direct support centers on Mermaid’s capabilities, CLI tools, and editor/runtime behavior, which underpin the recommended approach described in the field value.",

The most direct support for these claims appears in passages that enumerate specific models (for example, OpenAI GPT-4.1 with a 1,047,576-token context window and a pricing profile; the o3/o4-mini family described as designed for deliberate reasoning with very long context windows; Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash with very large context capabilities; Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku with a 200k token window; Meta’s LLaMA 4 with a claimed very large (multi-million) context potential; and DeepSeek variants with long-context emphasis). Several excerpts explicitly pair each model with the recommended subtask (for example, “Long-document processing. Ideal for processing the entire Constitution of India in a single context and for generating high-fidelity Mermaid code due to its superior coding strength and long-context capabilities.”). The excerpts also provide concrete cost notes (for GPT-4.1: “$2/M input and $8/M output tokens”) and performance assertions (e.g., “1,047,576-token context window,” “200,000-token context window” for o3/o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku) that align with the field value’s emphasis on long-context capability and coding strength. Additional excerpts describe the context windows and pricing for o4-mini and Gemini variants, reinforcing the expectation that these models are suitable for large, structured outputs and long documents. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the field value’s claims about model options, their long-context capabilities, cost considerations, and recommended use cases for the Constitution-diagram task.",

The excerpts confirm the project uses Mermaid diagrams and has produced dozens of diagrams, with explicit mentions of Mermaid diagrams and the quantity around 37 in several lines. The strongest single support comes from a statement indicating Mermaid diagrams were created and that 37 diagrams exist, which aligns with the general scope of the project described in the field value but does not confirm the exact 39-count or the precise directory and formatting conventions. Other excerpts corroborate the use of a visual-diagram workflow and a completed body of diagrams, further suggesting that the project has produced a large set of diagrams and emphasizes structured, schematic outputs. Overall, while the excerpts strongly support the existence of Mermaid-based visual diagrams and a high diagram count, they do not definitively confirm the exact number (39) or the exact organizational details (Mermaid01/Markdown directory and specific layout/color conventions) stated in the field value.

This supports including Mermaid as an option for a lightweight interactive viewer and informs design trade-offs between simplicity and richer interactions. - The Mermaid Live Editor and Mermaid’s general documentation underline practical rendering in the browser, which aligns with the need for an interactive viewer that can render diagrams from text, with potential for edge/link interactions when security settings permit. - Descriptions of Mermaid Diagram Rendering reinforce that Mermaid can produce SVG diagrams from textual definitions, which is relevant for building a diagram viewer that relies on text-to-diagram pipelines. - Discussions of Mermaid Intro/Overview and Mermaid Homepage emphasize the tool’s accessibility and ease of use, relevant for a viewer intended for broad audiences while balancing advanced features. - References to Cytoscape.js as a capable graph visualization library with a robust event model and mobile gestures support (pinch-to-zoom) map directly to the requirement for a high-performance, interactive viewer capable of rich interactions and mobile accessibility. - D3.js and d3-graphviz are cited as flexible, powerful rendering stacks that allow custom interactions and animated transitions, which supports the field’s option for more customized viewer experiences where D3+WASM-based layouts are desirable. - React Flow combined with Elk.js is described as a declarative React solution with Ely layout capabilities, which aligns with building a componentized, interactive viewer with sophisticated layout options. - WebGL-based options like Sigma.js and Ogma are mentioned for very large graphs, supporting the field’s performance/deployment requirement for scaling interactive diagrams. - The references to deep-linking, cross-diagram linking, and source-text anchoring appear in the broader viewer design discussion (as suggested by the excerpts about linking, navigation, and text anchoring concepts in diagram contexts), supporting the explicit need to design a viewer with navigable, source-linked diagrams. - Core features such as deep-linking, cross-diagram linking, and search/highlight align with the general capabilities described in the tool discussions (e.g., search and filtering considerations within interactive graph viewers) and provide concrete design targets. - Accessibility/mobile design considerations are echoed in the content emphasizing mobile-friendly layouts and keyboard-accessible interactions for diagram tools, reinforcing that any viewer should be mobile-first and accessible. - Performance/deployment guidance (LOD, web workers, virtualization, WASM, WebGL) aligns with the excerpts mentioning high-performance rendering options and the use of WASM for layout, which supports a scalable viewer design suitable for large constitutional graphs. - In short, the most relevant excerpts directly discuss the capabilities and trade-offs of Mermaid, Cytoscape.js, D3, d3-graphviz, and React Flow/Elk.js, plus related performance and deployment considerations, all of which map cleanly to the fine-grained field value about interactive viewer design and its key features.",

One excerpt introduces Decision Requirements Modeling with DMN, outlining a systematic approach to develop a complete decision model for legal reasoning tasks. This directly supports the idea of transforming constitution provisions into executable, repeatable decision logic in a human- and machine-readable form. - Another excerpt explains what DMN is and why it is suitable: DMN provides a modeling language and a graphical, readable structure (with decision tables and DRDs) that can capture inputs and rules for constitutional provisions like presidential eligibility or MP disqualification. This underpins the creative_enhancement_opportunities by offering a formal, interoperable backbone for diagrams representing constitutional logic. - A further DMN-focused piece emphasizes the power and utility of DMN for decision modeling in practice, reinforcing how the DMN paradigm can structure constitutional reasoning in a way that supports automated evaluation and explainability. - An additional excerpt discusses designing a decision service using DMN models, which aligns with building end-to-end tooling where constitutional rules are modeled, versioned, and executable within a decision service, enabling reproducible scenarios and auditing. - The open-form examples in these excerpts explicitly mention using DMN tools to export to XML and to model complex eligibility criteria, which echoes the goal of creating DMN-based representations of articles (like Article 58 or Article 102) where multiple inputs determine outcomes. - The snippets on JSON-based structured outputs and constrained decoding relate to validation, ensuring that the outputs of the DMN-augmented diagrams and simulators can be machine-validated against a schema, which is essential for reliable integration and auditing. - The mention of OpenFisca and Catala as platforms for executable legal scenarios provides concrete, implementable approaches for interactive simulators that can test constitutional provisions under varying inputs, reinforcing the interactive_scenario_simulators axis. - The graph-based QA concept is articulated in the DMN and related DMN-excerpt content, which supports constructing a knowledge graph that ties constitutional entities (Presidents, Parliament, Articles) to their rules and outputs, enabling natural-language queries over a structured evidentiary base. - Overall, the cited excerpts collectively confirm that the envisioned three-part field value (DMN-based enhancement, interactive scenario simulators, and graph-based QA with validation) is well-supported by existing DMN modeling literature and practical DMN-driven design guidance.

Excerpts establish the foundational practice of generating structured outputs that adhere to a JSON schema and using constrained decoding to guarantee format and compliance. Specifically:\n- The need for structured output generation using a JSON schema and grammar-based decoding is supported by statements that LLMs typically produce freeform text unless constrained, and that structured JSON with defined fields can be produced with appropriate decoding strategies. This aligns with the user’s goal of enforcing a schema-driven workflow and using prompts that guide verification against the schema.\n- Constrained decoding around JSON Schema is highlighted as standard in the field, indicating that using a schema to constrain outputs helps ensure format and constraint compliance, which is essential for any multi-stage verification process that depends on a valid schema.\n- References to structured outputs capabilities (e.g., guided_json, structured outputs) demonstrate practical techniques for achieving the same goals of reliability and schema adherence described by the user, illustrating that a multi-stage verification system is a recognized approach within existing tooling and best practices.\n- Additional sources discuss benchmarking and evaluation frameworks for JSON schemas in LLM outputs, reinforcing the relevance of schema-based validation and the broader ecosystem that supports reliable structured generation.\nFrom these connections, the excerpts support the idea that the user’s proposed multi-stage verification and error-recovery prompts should be built on a foundation of strict, schema-driven, constrained-output generation, and that introducing a self-critique or chain-of-verification step is compatible with established approaches to ensuring accuracy and schema compliance.",

The most relevant excerpts directly discuss those standards and their roles in structuring and reasoning about legal texts. From the Akoma Ntoso family, the excerpts describe AKAN as a machine-readable XML representation for legislative/judicial documents and emphasize its role as a foundational layer for encoding document structure (parts, articles, clauses, metadata, content) and lifecycle management, which supports the idea of building a robust data model on a well-defined structural standard. Other excerpts describe the LegalRuleML core specification, including its features for defeasible rules, deontic logic, and the isomorphism concept that ties formal rules back to the original textual source, which directly aligns with the need for a standards-based, semantically rich representation of legal rules. Additional excerpts discuss the PROV-O Ontology, which provides provenance information interchange, reinforcing the notion that a rigorous data model should include provenance and traceability for legal artifacts. Together, these excerpts substantiate the recommended stack: Akoma Ntoso for document structure, LKIF Core for semantic descriptions of legal concepts (norms, actions, agents, roles), and LegalRuleML for rule representation with defeasibility and deontic modalities, with PROV-O supporting provenance. The emphasis on isomorphism in LegalRuleML also underlines the requirement that formal representations remain directly linked to the authoritative textual sources, ensuring governance and traceability in the model. The inclusion of discussions around OASIS/standards-oriented specifications in these excerpts further reinforces the claim that the data model should be built upon established standards rather than a bespoke schema, providing interoperability and academic rigor as described in the value. In short, the most directly supportive content identifies specific standards (Akoma Ntoso, LegalRuleML) and related semantic/provenance frameworks, which together justify a layered, standards-driven approach to the data model for legal logic.

Related excerpts describe the ingestion and storage of the Constitution’s source PDFs in a .zzRef directory and the extraction of text into a single plain text file in RAWDATA, which aligns with the ingestion and text extraction sub-step of the pipeline. Subsequent excerpts outline the repository’s status and the high-level pipeline steps (text extraction, analysis, and diagram rendering), which corroborates the orchestration and provenance aspects of the pipeline (i.e., an auditable, end-to-end flow from source materials to visual outputs). The early excerpts explicitly call out the stored source materials and extracted text, including references to PREAMBLE, ARTICLES, and the indexing of the constitutional text in the RAWDATA folder, which reinforces the segmentation/processing logic required for step_2 segmentation.

Excerpts emphasize that out-of-the-box LLMs produce freeform text and that constraints via JSON schemas, grammar-based decoding, and guided-output options are effective for producing valid, well-formed structured outputs. This aligns with the need for a deterministic Mermaid code block that adheres to specific layout and syntax rules, such as using a top-down graph, short alphanumeric node IDs, square-bracketed labels, and explicit connection arrows. The discussion of JSON Schema as a standard for constrained decoding and the evaluation benchmarks for such constrained outputs provides a solid rationale for designing prompts and tooling that enforce the required structure and formatting for the Mermaid diagram generation task. The references to guided_json and other structured-output features illustrate practical mechanisms to achieve the deterministic formatting demanded by the fine-grained field value, including ensuring schema compliance and preventing stray text or formatting from leaking into the final Mermaid code block.",

This directly supports the need to clearly attribute the Government of India as the source when diagrams are derived from constitutional text. In addition, several excerpts define what constitutes a \"government work\" and explain who owns the copyright in government works, clarifying that the government can be the first owner of copyright and that such works are governed by the government’s rights. This establishes the legal basis for asserting attribution to the Government of India for the constitutional content used in diagrams. Another excerpt further explains the duration and terms related to government works, reinforcing that attribution and clear ownership are non-negotiable aspects of using government-origin content. A separate excerpt presents website policy language from a government-related site, underscoring that site policies require clear source attribution for reproduced material, which complements the attribution principle for a main project page. Finally, while the Constitution’s text is not a licensing document, the surrounding context in the excerpts about official government text and its handling of sources corroborates the necessity of treating the constitutional material as originating from official sources and warranting proper attribution and disclaimers when used in visual diagrams. Taken together, these excerpts support the need for (1) prominent attribution to the Government of India (e.g., Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice) as the source of the constitutional text, and (2) a comprehensive disclaimer on the project’s main page asserting educational use only, non-legal-advice status, potential for interpretation or error, and directing users to official authenticated versions for legal purposes.",

References to Mermaid-related documentation and tasks (MermaidTasks.md) indicate ongoing reliance on Mermaid for diagram creation and task tracking. Several excerpts mention PDF extraction tools (PDF Plumber and PyPDF) used to obtain textual data, supporting the assertion of a PDF-text extraction component in the workflow. The README and related notes emphasize a structured, text-to-diagram pipeline using Mermaid, consistent with the described workflow. Taken together, these excerpts support the portrayal of a relatively manual process with Mermaid as the core diagram tool, a PDF-to-text preprocessing step, and limited evidence of automation beyond scripting, aligning with the stated high human effort. The presence of a dedicated PDF-to-text conversion note and explicit tooling references (PDF Plumber, PyPDF) corroborates the claimed tooling setup, while the absence of explicit automated build scripts or CI/CD mentions in these excerpts suggests low to no automation, consistent with a medium confidence assessment rather than high certainty, given the indirect nature of some conclusions.",

First, the notion that constrained decoding around JSON Schema yields more reliable, well-formed outputs is directly supported: structured outputs are standardized by JSON Schema and constrained decoding frameworks ensure compliance with the schema, reducing freeform deviations. This aligns with the goal of including explicit target schema within the prompt to anchor the model's output to a predetermined structure. Second, the emphasis on generating valid JSON with pre-defined fields and formats demonstrates that guiding the model to produce a rigid schema is an effective mechanism for reliability in extraction tasks. Third, the use of role specification and step-by-step instructions, along with few-shot or one-shot examples showing the mapping from constitutional text to the exact JSON block, directly supports the idea of a multimodal prompt that sets expectations and demonstrates correct formatting. Fourth, explicitly requiring that the model output only the JSON block, without conversational text or markdown, reinforces the constraint-based approach central to robust extraction in legal contexts. Taken together, these excerpts provide converging evidence that a prompt pattern leveraging a defined schema, role guidance, example-driven demonstrations, and strict output constraints is a sound strategy for extracting legal logic into a canonical JSON format. The presence of JSON Schema as a core component and the emphasis on constrained decoding solidify the relevance of the proposed finegrained field value.",

The most directly relevant material discusses website policies and general governance around government text and copyright. This provides a foundation for requiring contributors to document sources and licensing terms, which aligns with the proposed need for templates that capture the source of the legal text and ensure proper attribution and compliance. Additionally, discussions about government works and their copyright status (for example, the duration and ownership of government works) reinforce the necessity of verifiable provenance and careful handling of such materials when included in a project, supporting the inclusion of a mandatory source-tracking checklist in Issues and PRs. References to fair dealing and copyright exceptions further justify the need for contributors to include commentary or context explaining how a given excerpt is being used and any limitations on reproduction, which underpins the proposed templates and review steps. Taken together, these excerpts justify a governance approach that enforces (1) source attribution and licensing checks, (2) inclusion of sufficient commentary/original material to comply with copyright, (3) self-review for accuracy against source text, and (4) a maintained review by a project maintainer or legal expert before merging. Although none of the excerpts describe a GitHub workflow verbatim, they collectively support the core principles needed to justify and design such a workflow in a governance-and-licensing context.",

      "reasoning": "The finegrained field value concerns governance and licensing considerations for tools and LLMs, specifically licensing terms (e.g., licenses of Mermaid, Graphviz, PlantUML) and data privacy when using cloud versus self-hosted LLMs. The most directly relevant information points to the copyright framework for government works and how licensing or ownership is determined in such works. For example, one excerpt explicitly discusses term of copyright in Government works, noting the duration of copyright when the government is the first owner, which informs how long and under what conditions government-produced content can be used or redistributed. This supports understanding of how government-created diagrams or constitutional texts may be licensed or restricted, and whether outputs derived from such works may inherit certain licensing constraints. Another excerpt clarifies the notion of a “Government work” and who may own copyright, which is foundational to assessing licensing obligations when incorporating government-produced material into a project. A separate excerpt addresses government copyright over bare acts, illustrating how government-held content can be treated differently from privately owned content, including potential implications for licensing and reuse. While not all excerpts speak directly to software licenses, they collectively establish the framework that governs who can license or reuse government-created content, which in turn shapes decisions about using open-source diagram tools and whether outputs may be considered derivative works under copyleft licenses. Additional excerpts touch on fair dealing and restrictions related to use and reproduction of copyrighted works, which informs considerations around permissible uses when integrating or transforming such content in a toolchain. Taken together, these excerpts provide a scaffold for determining permissible licensing strategies and the boundaries between government ownership, licensing rights, and permissible transformations in a tooling/LLM context.",

The excerpt stating Current Achievement: Complete constitutional coverage aligns with the field value’s emphasis on 100% coverage of the Constitution. Additional excerpts noting 100% constitutional coverage in the project’s README and statistics corroborate this claim. References that indicate the project created Mermaid diagrams, including mentions of Mermaid-related folders and a naming convention (e.g., M[number] topic) directly support the notion of a Mermaid-based diagram set and the organized structure described in the field value. Several excerpts enumerate the number of diagrams produced (though some list 37 diagrams rather than 39), which is highly pertinent because it shows close alignment with the 39-diagram claim but also reveals a potential discrepancy. Other excerpts provide context about the project structure, navigation maps, and Mermaid tasks, which reinforce the field’s attributes about organization and navigability (Complete Navigation Map, topic categorization, and user journeys). Taken together, these excerpts strongly support the core aspects of the field value (Mermaid diagrams, 100% constitutional coverage, organized naming and navigation), while also highlighting the discrepancy in the exact diagram count (37 vs 39) that affects full definitive alignment.",

      "reasoning": "The most directly relevant information is the explicit description and functions of the proviso and related clauses. A proviso is defined as a clause that is appended to a main provision and typically starts with 'Provided that', and its function is described as saving or excepting from the general rule, or, in some contexts, qualifying or clarifying the main enactment. This directly maps to the finegrained field’s typology by identifying a structured way to model conditional carve-outs and exceptions within constitutional texts. In the excerpts, the proviso’s roles are enumerated as: (a) exclusionary, (b) qualifying, and (c) clarificatory, and it is noted that the proviso is often used to save rights in spite of other provisions. This directly supports the typology’s emphasis on a flexible, sometimes substantive, conditional element that can alter the scope of the main rule, which is essential for diagrammatic representations (flowcharts with decision nodes, and DMN rules with higher-priority rows). The presented definitions also emphasize the necessity of preserving the main enactment’s intent while carving out exceptions, which underpins how one would structure diagrams to reflect hierarchy and precedence (main path with branches for exceptions, or top-priority rules that override subsequent ones). The non-obstante clause is described as giving an overriding effect that can supplant conflicting provisions, which aligns with the field’s guidance on representing overrides in diagrams (e.g., using preemptive paths or distinct visual cues). This is reinforced by explicit statements that a non-obstante clause “gives full force and effect to the provision it introduces, irrespective of conflicting provisions,” and that it may operate as an override to be harmonized with the Constitution’s basic structure. The saving clause is likewise presented as preserving existing rights or transitional arrangements when a law changes, which maps to preserving legacy states in diagrams and ensuring smooth transitions in DMN or flowcharts. The excerpts further discuss multi-party decision authority as a pattern requiring sequential or parallel decisions by multiple actors, which is essential for modeling constitutional processes that involve several stages before finalizing a decision, and it highlights the need for conditional triggers and feedback loops in diagrams. Finally, broader DMN and structured-output considerations are present, illustrating how these constructs can be captured in decision tables (e.g., higher-priority rules for non-obstante, explicit proviso rows) and how to visually distinguish types of rules using color, shape, or layout to convey precedence and overrides. In short, the excerpts provide both definitions of the constructs and explicit modeling guidance that matches the finegrained field’s content and the projected diagrammatic representations.",

The detailed discussion of Section 28 (as part of Government works) indicates that copyright in Government works subsists for a defined period, reinforcing the premise that such texts can be protected. The Copyright Act’s Section 52(1) provides specific exceptions for Acts of a Legislature when published with commentary or other original matter, which directly informs how diagrams of the Constitution could be reproduced: publishing a bare Act diagram might run afoul of copyright unless accompanied by commentary or transformed into original analysis. Related explanations of fair dealing and public-use allowances further clarify permissible uses when not reproducing the bare text verbatim. Collectively, these excerpts support the claim that special care is needed to avoid infringing copyright by ensuring diagrams are presented with commentary or as original material, aligning with the exception for Acts of a Legislature when accompanied by analysis. The excerpts also discuss government copyright over bare Acts, reinforcing the need to treat the Constitution text within the framework of government-owned content and to structure diagrams accordingly.",

Excerpts that describe using an LLM to generate semantically coherent chunks, and that emphasize semantic chunking as a strategy, directly support the idea that semantic chunking improves contextual relevance but may incur higher computational cost. Excerpts that describe document-based or structural chunking—splitting by the document’s intrinsic structure such as headings, sections, and legal articles—support the claim that structural chunking aligns well with the Constitution’s organization and preserves legal context, though chunk sizes can become highly variable. Excerpts that discuss fixed-size chunking and sliding/overlapping window approaches directly address the simplicity, scalability, and risks of arbitrary sentence cuts and context loss, which aligns with the field value’s caution about fixed-size chunking in legal texts. The presence of RAG-related discussions reinforces practical considerations for retrieval and assembly of chunks in a legal-information workflow, which underpins the trade-offs between simplicity and contextual fidelity. Taken together, these excerpts collectively map onto the field value’s three-tier comparison (Fixed-Size, Semantic, Structural/Document-Based) and the cited trade-offs (simplicity vs contextual accuracy, computational cost, and suitability for well-structured documents like the Constitution). The most directly supportive content explicitly names fixed-size, semantic, and structural chunking strategies and comments on their merits and drawbacks, which aligns with the described finegrained field value. Later excerpts add context about overlapping strategies and practical workflow considerations, further reinforcing the nuanced trade-offs highlighted in the field value.",

Together, these excerpts align to the specific claim of comprehensive coverage and currency, even though the exact article count (395) is not directly echoed in the excerpts. The combination of complete coverage, full Parts and Schedules scope, and up-to-date amendment information provides a cohesive backing for the field value. The line-count figure further substantiates the scale of the analysis, while the update notes confirm currency with the 106th Amendment as of 2023.",

The cited content describing the analysis process as distributing text into 100-line chunks underscores a procedural, manual-heavy workflow, reinforcing the claim of a labor-intensive and hard-to-scale operation. A peripheral but relevant point is the mention of specific tooling and documentation around the Mermaid diagrams and repository tasks, which while not a limitation itself, helps frame the project as tool-driven and potentially lacking automated pathways to adapt to future changes (e.g., future amendments) unless explicitly designed for it.",

Excerpts describing LegalRuleML core specifications and their features—such as modeling norms, defeasibility, isomorphism between law text and formal rules, time and events, and deontic operators—directly support the claim that the proposed model relies on LegalRuleML as a core formalism for rules and normative reasoning. These excerpts also emphasize the representation of rules, counterfactuals, and the justification of conclusions within a structured, machine-readable format, which aligns with the field value’s emphasis on a layered structure capturing structure, semantics, and operational rules. Excerpts that discuss Akoma Ntoso establish the XML/IDL groundwork and interoperability expectations that would underpin the physical hierarchy and document-level alignment referenced in the field value. Together, these sources corroborate the combination of Akoma Ntoso for document representation and LegalRuleML (along with LKIF-inspired semantics) for normative reasoning and rule representation. The broader discussion around rule reification, deontic modalities, and time attributes further reinforces the envisioned layered schema that includes clauses, articles, and rules mapped into a JSON-like schema. While there are references to provenance and ontology standards (e.g., PROV-O) in some excerpts, they provide contextual support about provenance interchange and ontological framing rather than being central to the exact proposed data model described in the field value. Therefore, the excerpts focusing on LegalRuleML core specs, Akoma Ntoso guidance, and their integration into a structured legal-logic model are the most directly relevant to the finegrained field value, with excerpts on related ontologies as supplementary context.",

The presence of up-to-date amendments and preface sections confirms the material is current and credible, which is crucial for maintaining alignment with the latest constitutional text. The design-patterns documentation offers practical guidance on structuring diagrams (pattern-based approaches), which informs how to prompt and parameterize an LLM to extend or adapt the existing diagrams rather than starting anew.

      "reasoning": "The target field value argues for a two-part approach: first exploit the document’s inherent structure to split content along natural organizational boundaries, and then apply recursive subdivision to portions that exceed the model’s context window while preserving sentence and paragraph boundaries. The strongest support comes from language that explicitly identifies document-based chunking as using the intrinsic structure of a document, including structural elements like headings and headers, and applying this to preserve logical blocks. This aligns with the idea of structural chunking that respects Parts, Articles, and Clauses. Additional support comes from references to recursive chunking, which explicitly describes subdividing long sections without fragmenting meaning. Together, these excerpts justify a hybrid approach that starts with structural chunking and then uses recursive chunking to manage long segments, preserving semantic integrity. Supporting information about using LLM-based chunking to create semantically coherent chunks reinforces that the chunking strategy should maintain meaning and context across boundaries, which is consistent with the proposed structural-first, recursive-second approach. References to overlapping or fixed-length strategies are less aligned with this specific hybrid, structure-aware objective but acknowledge alternative methods for context maintenance when necessary.",

The most directly supporting content is guidance about Mermaid usage and syntax validation: stating to use a Mermaid syntax guide and to perform syntax checks and proper code block handling, as well as ensuring nodes and labels are properly bracketed, and that the Mermaid code blocks are properly enclosed. This aligns with incorporating Mermaid-specific validation into a CI workflow, and suggests that syntax-related checks (like ensuring the code blocks are closed and the graph direction is correct) are central to syntactic validation. The excerpts that discuss validating Mermaid files for syntax issues, extracting code blocks for validation, and checking proper subgraph syntax provide concrete, direct support for Mermaid syntactic validation in a CI context. Additional excerpts reinforce general Mermaid syntax conventions (e.g., Always use graph TD for main graph, and ensuring proper bracket usage), which further corroborate Mermaid-focused syntactic validation in a CI-like process. The remaining excerpts touch on broader topics like structured outputs, JSON schema benchmarks, and models for other domains, which are not directly relevant to this specific syntactic validation claim for Mermaid or the other tools named in the field value; thus their relevance is lower in supporting the stated multi-tool CI validation strategy beyond Mermaid.",

The excerpts collectively corroborate this workflow: the project documentation explicitly states an extraction step yielding 20,115 lines and a task division into 202 x 100-line chunks, which aligns with a systematic, task-based process. There are clear notes that the constitutional text analyzed comprises about 20,115 lines, reinforcing the scale and completeness of the analysis. Additional excerpts confirm the existence of a defined analysis process and the completion of a fixed set of analysis tasks (202/202), which supports the claim of a structured, task-driven methodology.

The most relevant excerpts directly describe Mermaid as a JavaScript tool that renders diagrams from a Markdown-based or Markdown-inspired syntax, highlighting its simplicity and wide support, which aligns with the stated tool of choice. Supporting excerpts further reinforce this by describing Mermaid’s ability to render diagrams, its availability via a live editor or API, and its general positioning as a lightweight, widely adopted diagramming solution. Additional excerpts compare Mermaid to other tools (e.g., PlantUML) and mention CLI usage for converting diagrams to SVG, which corroborates practical deployment considerations and tooling options for diagrams within a documentation workflow. Collectively, these excerpts substantiate the field value’s claims about Mermaid.js, its Markdown-based definition approach, ease of use for LLM-driven diagram generation, and the practical avenues (live editor, API, CLI) available for producing and deploying diagrams in the Constituition of India decision-flow diagrams context.

In particular, the notion of JSONSchemaBench introduces a concrete benchmark for structured outputs, aligning with the idea of evaluating how faithfully a diagram or its textual representation maps to the source material. The discussion of enforcing constraint compliance through JSON Schema and guided generation demonstrates practical approaches to measuring fidelity by ensuring generated diagrams adhere to a formal, verifiable structure. Merely validating diagram syntax (e.g., Mermaid structure and connections) supports reproducible fidelity checks at the diagram-creation level, which complements higher-level content accuracy assessments. Collectively, these excerpts provide the building blocks and evaluation paradigms (structured outputs, schema-driven validation, benchmarks) that underpin fidelity metrics for diagram-based representations of legal text. Specific connections include: using predefined JSON formats to capture diagram metadata in a verifiable schema, applying constrained decoding to guarantee schema compliance, and leveraging benchmarks that quantify schema-conformance and related similarity metrics as proxies for fidelity. These elements map to the stated fidelity metrics by enabling coverage checking against source text and by offering quantitative counterparts (e.g., similarity-based measures) to assess content accuracy.",

Excerpts describing the use of structured outputs and JSON schemas directly support the notion of evaluating generated diagrams with precise, verifiable formats and constraints (e.g., constrained decoding and JSON schemas). The mention of a benchmark for structured outputs specifically underscores a formal, quantitative approach to evaluation, which underpins Diagrams Compile Rate, Precision/Recall of conditions, and content accuracy when diagrams are produced and validated against source texts. In addition, references to guided JSON/structured outputs and JSONSchemaBench illustrate practical mechanisms for enforcing and measuring exact content, which aligns with monitoring hallucinations and citation coverage. Practical Mermaid validation guidance (checking syntax blocks, ensuring proper subgraph syntax, closing code blocks, and label formatting) provides concrete methods to measure and improve Diagram Compile Rate by ensuring generated Mermaid files are syntactically correct. Contextual notes about Mermaid syntax guides reinforce the diagram generation workflow, including choosing a diagram language and ensuring valid outputs. References to JSON-schema-driven or structured-output tooling (e.g., JSONSchemaBench, constrained decoding, structured outputs in vLLM) further connect to the idea of systematically evaluating the content accuracy and fidelity of diagrams against source materials. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the concept of automated validation metrics and structured-output-driven evaluation for the LLM-based diagram generation pipeline.",

Additionally, the Constitution’s English text and its contents/sections (Preamble, Part I, Articles, etc.) provide the canonical structural elements that could anchor state diagrams, where each article or part could represent a state or a set of states, and transitions could be mapped to legal events or triggers described in the constitutional framework. The presence of the document's contents (prelude, enumerated parts, and articles) supplies the granular elements that diagram authors would need to define states and transitions. Lastly, supplementary constitutional references (such as discussions around joint sessions and specific constitutional provisions) illustrate real-world processes and events that could act as transition triggers in a lifecycle diagram of a legal status, such as a state moving from one enforceability regime to another in response to constitutional events.",

The excerpts primarily discuss Mermaid-based tooling and comparisons, which informs the broader landscape of diagramming options, including their ease of use, interactivity, and tooling support. The most directly relevant content notes that Mermaid and PlantUML are common diagram options, and one excerpt explicitly compares PlantUML with Mermaid, illustrating that for decision-flow diagrams you must weigh dedicated diagram DSLs against more flexible or richer ecosystems. This context helps assess trade-offs when considering Graphviz DOT as a backend: DOT is a robust, text-based graph language with strong layout control, but the excerpts emphasize higher-level, Markdown-like, or UI-friendly workflows (Mermaid) and the existence of other ecosystems (PlantUML, D2). Therefore, these excerpts support the general premise that while Graphviz DOT could serve as a foundational engine, the user would compare its determinism and verbosity against Markdown-inspired or DSL approaches, the potential for interactivity, and licensing implications illustrated by the surrounding discussions. The evidence suggests that Mermaid-based tooling is well-supported and approachable for LLM-driven diagram generation, while Graphviz DOT would offer strong layout capabilities but may require more integration effort to achieve interactivity and seamless LLM prompting, as indicated by notes on static output and potential need to combine with other libraries for interactivity.",

      "reasoning": "The most directly relevant material establishes the core drafting constructs and their functional roles. Content describing provisos as clauses appended to main provisions to create exceptions or qualifications, and detailing its four possible roles (exclusionary, qualifying, clarificatory, and, in some circumstances, substantive) directly maps to the taxonomy’s Proviso and its functions. This supports the field’s need to identify when a proviso serves as an exception, a condition, a clarifying addendum, or an excusive modifier. Additional material explicitly stating the exclusionary, qualifying, and clarificatory roles provides concrete, citable support for the taxonomy’s subcategories under Proviso. Content that discusses the proper function of a proviso as a means to exclude, qualify, or clarify aligns with the taxonomy’s explicit constructs and will help a diagramming system distinguish between these uses in constitutional text. The Non-Obstante doctrine excerpts describe an overriding provision that takes precedence over conflicting provisions, which directly supports the Non-Obstante Clause node in the taxonomy and clarifies its priority relationship in the hierarchy of constitutional provisions. Related discussions on Notwithstanding and its interaction with other provisions further reinforce the contextual use of override clauses and help differentiate Notwithstanding from the more general Non-Obstante concept in the taxonomy. Contextual constitutional contents and references to the Constitution of India PDFs provide real-world instances and terminology corroborating the exact wording and usage of these constructs in the Indian legal text, which is essential for accurate diagramming and labeling. Taken together, these excerpts strongly support the field value’s framing of Proviso (and its sub-functions), Non-Obstante Clause, and related modifiers such as saving provisions, subject-to relations, and actor/trigger/condition concepts, since they supply explicit definitions, roles, and usage patterns that a diagrammatic taxonomy should capture.",

The clearest support comes from excerpts that address Mermaid diagram usage and validation. The excerpt that introduces Mermaid Validation Script and Procedures explicitly ties diagrams to Mermaid syntax (graph TD or graph TB), which is the direct source format whose structure would be analyzed to compute graph-related metrics. The follow-up excerpt notes that connections use proper arrows (-->), reinforcing that diagrams encode directional graph edges, a prerequisite for counting edges and assessing connectivity. A checklist excerpt further emphasizes proper Mermaid diagram file structure and explicit Mermaid code blocks, underscoring that accurate parsing depends on correctly formatted Mermaid source. Other excerpts discuss structured outputs and JSON schemas, which, while relevant to constrained decoding and output formatting, do not directly substantiate the mechanics of parsing diagram graphs to obtain node/edge counts, depth, or cyclomatic complexity. Therefore, the most relevant content directly supports the need to validate and parse Mermaid diagram sources before computing the stated structural metrics, with less direct support from surrounding content that is about general structured outputs rather than diagram graph analysis.",

The excerpts most closely related to this claim are those that indicate a visual documentation project for constitutional analysis (which could be implemented via diagramming tools such as DMN diagrams) and excerpts that discuss constitutional content structure (pre/postambles, parts, articles) that such diagrams would represent. The material about proviso usage in legislative drafting and non-obstante doctrine illustrates related concepts (exceptions, qualification, precedence) that DMN could encode as rule rows or decision logic, but they do not themselves provide direct evidence that DMN is used or recommended.

Excerpts that describe LLM-based chunking and semantically coherent chunking directly support how RAG operates as a retrieval-first step that yields better context for the generator. Specifically, explicit references to LLM-based chunking that allows semantically meaningful division of text align with how RAG identifies and uses small, highly relevant text chunks rather than treating the entire document as a single input. Excerpts explaining that RAG prevents loss of key information when transitioning between chunks, and that it is great for sequential or reference-heavy texts (like laws) provide concrete advantages in legal contexts and support the claim that RAG improves accuracy, speed, and source citation. Additionally, notes on sliding-window approaches that preserve context across overlapping chunks reinforce how RAG maintains continuity and reduces information gaps when retrieving relevant sections. Some excerpts describe document-based chunking aligned with document structure (headings, sections, or PDFs) which further clarifies practical methods to enable effective RAG in structured legal texts. While one excerpt focuses on fixed-length chunking, which is a simpler baseline, it is included as context to contrast against more sophisticated RAG-ready approaches. Collectively, the most supportive content directly states or implies that a retrieval-augmented approach enhances performance and traceability in legal document analysis, with concrete chunking strategies that facilitate RAG. The less direct items provide broader background on chunking strategies that underpin the practical deployment of RAG but do not themselves state the superiority claim as emphatically, thus they are secondary to the core assertion.",

There is additional support from benchmarks showing improved multi-document review accuracy when using a capable long-context model, which reinforces the value of extended context in handling multiple sections of a long document like a constitution.

      "reasoning": "The finegrained field value provides a concrete mapping scheme for translating legal concepts into diagrammatic flowchart elements. Key points include: (a) a proviso can function as an exception, a qualifier, or a clarifier, which aligns with how a diagram would represent conditional branches or special cases within a main process flow; (b) a proviso’s exclusionary or qualifying role suggests modeling it as conditional logic or a separate rule block linked to the main flow; (c) a non-obstante clause is explicitly described as something that overrides or terminates conflicting paths, which maps to a prominent override annotation or a prioritized path in the diagram; (d) modal verbs like ‘shall’ and ‘may’ map to standard process blocks (mandatory) or decision nodes (discretionary), guiding the typology of diagram elements; (e) actors and cross-references are common diagram concepts, often represented with swimlanes and connectors to manage complexity; and (f) there is an established precedent of producing visual diagrams for constitutional analysis, indicating practical feasibility and prior workflow design in this domain. The cited excerpts collectively support these mappings by detailing the functional roles of provisos, the purpose of non-obstante clauses, and the conventional diagrammatic representations of conditions, exceptions, and mandatory actions. For instance, discussions on the proper function of a proviso describing exclusionary, qualifying, and clarificatory roles directly map to conditional branches, separate rule blocks, and clarifying notes in flowcharts. Descriptions of provisos as something that “excludes,” “qualifies,” or clarifies provide concrete matching patterns for how to encode those elements in a diagram. The notes on non-obstante clauses as overriding or prioritizing paths support the idea of an annotation or priority path that visually communicates precedence. Statements about ‘shall’ as mandatory actions and ‘may’ as discretionary actions directly translate to process blocks versus decision nodes. Additional contextual support comes from the notion of a visual documentation project that has completed constitutional analyses with diagrams, underscoring the practical application of these mapping rules in real diagramming work. Taken together, these excerpts coherently justify a diagram-first approach where flowcharts encode sequential steps, diamond decision nodes handle yes/no triggers, provisos branch or become sub-flows, non-obstante notes indicate overrides, and related concepts like actors and connectors manage complexity. The overall confidence in applying these mappings to the field value is reinforced by multiple, thematically aligned sources that repeatedly connect legal constructs to specific diagrammatic representations.",

Among the excerpts, several describe Mermaid as a diagramming tool and its general capabilities: a JavaScript-based diagramming approach that uses Markdown-like text definitions to render diagrams, its rendering in various environments, and how Mermaid supports a range of diagram types. These excerpts are most directly relevant to the broader question of which diagram tool to use and how such tools conceptually render diagrams, which informs tool-selection and capability considerations for building a viewer. Other excerpts describe Mermaid’s editor, live rendering, and syntax references, which further contextualize how Mermaid can be used but do not address accessibility or mobile-first design specifics. There is no explicit guidance in the excerpts about accessibility standards (WCAG), keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, or a Cytoscape.js implementation, so these aspects cannot be supported by the provided material.

Excerpts that discuss Mermaid—its usage, the live editing environment, and its general capabilities—provide necessary context for evaluating alternatives, showing what the current standard options are and how they are typically used in practice. An excerpt comparing PlantUML and Mermaid frames Mermaid within the broader tool landscape, which helps frame why D2 might be a favorable alternative. A CLI-focused excerpt about Mermaid illustrates practical tooling options and workflows that any pipeline (including an LLM-driven one) would encounter, underscoring the operational differences between Mermaid-centric and D2-centric workflows. Taken together, these excerpts support the claim that D2 is a strong, modern alternative with layout-engine capabilities, while Mermaid remains a widely used baseline and point of comparison for features and tooling. Direct quotes used in reasoning include the explicit statement that D2 is discussed under layout engines and that D2 documentation references its ability to work with multiple layout engines, which corroborates the finegrained field’s emphasis on D2 as a modern, LLm-friendly option with flexible diagramming capabilities.",

These directly map to a CI integration plan that enforces diagram quality gates such as validity, readability, and structural correctness. Beyond that, references to generating structured outputs and JSON schemas emphasize the broader automation and validation paradigm: they highlight enforcing schema-conformant outputs as part of automated checks, which complements the idea of gating changes based on whether the diagram and its metadata meet predefined standards. Additional excerpts extend this by discussing constrained decoding and JSON-schema-centric validation in LLM workflows, which supports the notion that a CI plan could include schema-based checks and automatic validation against a predefined format, even if not diagram-specific. A few excerpts touch on general workflow and tooling discussions for structured outputs, which, while not diagram-specific, reinforce the practicality of automated validation in a CI-like process. Overall, the strongest direct evidence for a CI-style integration plan comes from Mermaid-focused validation guidance, with supportive context from structured-output and schema-validation discussions.",

The existence of a benchmark focused on reliable structured outputs reinforces the feasibility of producing precise, evidence-backed responses from LLMs. - The JSONSchemaBench work underscores constrained decoding and schema-driven generation, which helps ensure that the system’s answers can be anchored to specific constitutional provisions or rules, preserving the evidence trail required for a graph-based RAG system. - The repository discussing law diagrams and its RAWDATA contents suggests concrete data assets (diagrams, texts) that could feed into a graph, providing the raw material needed to build nodes (entities/concepts) and edges (relationships) for the knowledge graph described in the field value. - Context on DMN (Decision Model and Notation) and decision-service design, although not explicitly about graph databases, is relevant because it demonstrates formalized rule representation and decision logic, which can inspire the way constitutional provisions and rules are encoded as graph-structured knowledge and queried by the QA system. - Together, these excerpts collectively support a workflow that (a) captures diagrams and textual rules in a structured, queryable format, (b) validates and constrains outputs with schemas, and (c) provides provenance-friendly data sources suitable for building a graph-based RAG system for constitutional Q&A.",

The excerpts that describe the function and purpose of provisos and non-obstante clauses give the conceptual justification for such visual separation: provisos serve to exclude, qualify, or clarify or to act as optional addenda, while non-obstante clauses override or harmonize provisions in certain contexts. This supports using distinct visual treatments (e.g., a specific color for general rules, another for exceptions, and a conspicuous cue for overrides) and explicitly labeling these relationships in diagrams. Additional guidance such as intentional use of arrows or beta-like emphasis for overrides aligns with the idea of clearly signaling overriding status in diagrams. The constitutional context excerpts reinforce that these constructs are core to legal interpretation and thus deserve clear, intuitive visual differentiation in decision-flow diagrams. Overall, the most relevant parts provide the justification for why such visual encodings are useful and what kinds of relationships (exception, exclusion, override) need to be distinguished, while less directly providing explicit visualization templates.

Excerpts that explicitly define a proviso and its functions provide direct support for the checklist item on correctly identifying provisos and handling their purposes (exclusionary, qualifying, clarificatory). A set of excerpts discusses how provisos act as exceptions, how they are used to limit or qualify the main enactment, and how their effects are confined to specific cases, which maps directly to the need to flag and distinguish exceptions within a diagram. Other excerpts elaborate the non-obstante concept, including how such clauses can alter the intendment of the enactment, set precedence, or override conflicting provisions, which aligns with the checklist item on precedence and override logic. Additional excerpts describe broader interpretations of non-obstante clauses and how they interact with statutory provisions, supporting the need for accurate precedence relationships and harmonization in the diagram. Together, these excerpts underpin the main checklist items: accurately identifying provisos and non-obstante clauses in source texts, ensuring the diagram reflects correct precedence and overrides, maintaining visual clarity between general rules and exceptions, verifying completeness of paths and conditions, grounding diagram elements to authoritative texts, and annotating with appropriate citations and context. The content thus directly supports the field value's emphasis on identification, precedence, clarity, completeness, grounding, and contextual annotations in diagramming constitutional and statutory rules.",

      "reasoning": "The finegrained field value seeks guidance on how to model precedence and logic for complex constitutional constructs in diagramming and decision-table tools. The most relevant passages describe the core functions of provisos and non-obstante clauses, which are exactly the constructs that determine precedence and exception handling in rules or flows. Provisos are described as tools that exclude, qualify, or clarify the main enactment, effectively creating exceptions or special cases that modify the general rule. This directly informs how you should represent exceptions or gating points in flowcharts, such that the main path is altered or conditional branches are activated when a proviso applies. The non-obstante doctrine is repeatedly framed as an override mechanism: it yields a preemptive effect, can bypass conflicting branches, and may be placed at the top of a decision table to dominate subsequent rules. This matches the requirement to depict an overriding rule or path that takes precedence over other branches in a model. Additionally, explicit statements that a proviso or non-obstante clause serves to limit, alter, or override the general language of an enactment reinforce the need to mark these elements with distinct visual or semantic prominence in diagrams (for flowcharts) or with higher-priority rows (for DMN decision tables). Together, these sources provide concrete guidance for two key modeling patterns you asked about: (1) showing a conditional gateway that captures an exception before applying the main rule, and (2) implementing an override path or top-priority rule that suppresses other branches when a non-obstante condition is met. The content also clarifies that such constructs have clear functions (exclusionary, qualifying, clarificatory) and precedence effects, which is valuable when choosing diagram types and prompt strategies to encode these semantics. In summary, the strongest support comes from descriptions of proviso functions and non-obstante overrides, which map directly to the modeling needs for precedence and logic in both flowcharts and DMN tables. Supporting context about the general purposes of provisos and non-obstante clauses helps validate the suggested visual emphasis and rule ordering in diagrams and tables. ",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value enumerates a typology of legal constructs, and the strongest support comes from excerpts that directly define and classify provisos. One excerpt states that a proviso is a clause that starts with 'provided that' and operates as a condition or qualification, and is frequently used to save or except rights. This directly maps to the core idea of provisos qualifying or carving out exceptions from main provisions. Another excerpt emphasizes that the proper function of a proviso is to exclude and to deal with a case that would otherwise fall within the main enactment, with its effect confined to that case. A third excerpt explicitly lists the main roles of provisos in legal drafting as exclusionary, qualifying, and clarificatory. Together, these excerpts robustly support the definitional and functional aspects of provisos, including their potential broad functionality beyond a simple exception. Additional excerpts expand on related clauses and their purposes: one notes that a proviso may serve four different purposes in interpreting legislation, including exclusionary, qualifying, clarificatory, and potentially other nuanced roles; another explains that the proper function of a proviso is to except and to deal with cases within the general language of the main enactment. Regarding non-obstante clauses, one excerpt explains that notwithstanding asserts that the provision will prevail despite other conflicting provisions, which supports understanding its overriding effect. There is also an excerpt that provides a general definition of non-obstante clauses, indicating they override conflicting provisions and are used to harmonize with broader constitutional principles. Contextual material about constitutional text demonstrates where these constructs appear in practice but is less about the typology per se; however, it reinforces how these constructs operate in real statutes and constitutional settings. In sum, the most directly supportive excerpts establish the definitional core and functional taxonomy of provisos (proviso as qualifying/excluding/clarifying; not just a simple exception) and outline the overriding nature and use of non-obstante clauses. Supporting context from related clauses helps situate their usage within statutory interpretation and constitutional application.",

This aligns with the described core intelligence step where each text chunk is fed to an LLM for deep analysis to extract entities, actors, conditions, procedural steps, actions, outcomes, and exceptions, and where the output is a structured representation rather than a diagram. Additional excerpts corroborate the workflow by noting that the Constitution’s text is analyzed and that the project produces visual diagrams only after analysis, which supports the notion of a preceding analytical step that yields a machine-readable representation to decouple logic extraction from visualization. A third excerpt emphasizes that the project covers constitutional parts and involves analysis of the full text, reinforcing the context that such automated analysis would operate over the entire document and extract structured logical components for downstream use. Collectively, these excerpts support the concept of an end-to-end pipeline where an LLM processes segmented legal text to produce a canonical JSON representation of extracted logic, enabling modularity and robustness before visualization.",

This excerpt also references an explicit segmentation step in the data processing pipeline (Text Extraction -> Tasks), which confirms that chunking is an implemented step in the end-to-end pipeline. While the field value also contemplates a more theoretically optimal hybrid approach (structural chunking by Article/Clause followed by recursive chunking), the provided excerpt does not describe this hybrid method, so the connection to that part of the field value is not supported by the excerpt. Therefore, the strongest support comes from the explicit fixed-size chunking implementation, with partial or no support for the proposed hybrid enhancement based on the excerpts given.",

Further support comes from mentions of a Live Editor and API access, indicating accessible tooling that encourages programmatic generation of diagrams rather than manual drawing. Additional context notes the broad range of diagram types and comparisons with other diagramming approaches, which helps establish a usable ecosystem for an LLM-driven workflow. A caveat appears where precision matters: the references describe that misspellings or misuse of certain keywords can break rendering, underscoring brittleness if the LLM output is not exact. The practical validation point is that the law-diagrams project’s success serves as real-world evidence for the approach's viability. Taken together, these excerpts support that Mermaid-like syntax is learnable for an LLM but requires careful prompt construction and output precision to avoid brittle rendering. This justifies a high confidence level about the field value, assuming careful handling of syntax.",

This positions the tool as a robust, low-level engine that can drive sophisticated diagrams and layouts, rather than just a high-level diagramming UI.\n\nThe most relevant excerpt explicitly discusses layout engines and how their choice can significantly influence overall diagram outcomes. This provides direct support for the idea that a foundational backend layout engine (with configurable layout options) is critical for producing complex graphs. It serves as concrete evidence that layout engine selection matters for diagram quality and behavior.\n\nOther excerpts focus on higher-level diagramming tools (Mermaid) and their usage, syntax, and rendering methods. While informative about the practicalities of creating diagrams, they do not strongly address the foundational backbone or backend engine capabilities described in the fine-grained field value. They can supplement understanding of how such a foundational engine might be used in practice (e.g., by driving diagrams via a backend, with Mermaid serving as one possible front-end or rendering approach), but they do not directly confirm the existence or role of a foundational backend engine like the one described.\n\nSelected content alignment: The reference to varying layout engines and their impact on the overall diagram system directly supports the notion that a foundational backend engine is central to complex layouts. The other excerpts about Mermaid provide context for implementation options but do not explicitly verify the existence or necessity of a foundational layout engine beyond general diagramming capabilities.\n",

It directly supports the idea that a diagramming tool can offer multiple layout engines, which is part of the field value. Additional excerpts indicate that the tool is JavaScript-based and renders diagrams from Markdown-like definitions, and that there are dynamic/Live Editor contexts for Mermaid, which aligns with the notion of interactivity and real-time editing that can enhance interactivity and readability. Other excerpts mention Mermaid as a diagramming tool, its live editing capabilities, and its broad diagram type support, which helps establish context for usability and readability considerations (though they do not explicitly state interactivity features). Taken together, these excerpts support the aspects of layout flexibility and potential interactivity/editability, while directly stating interactivity features remains implicit in the provided content and is inferred from related live-editing capabilities and dynamic rendering claims.",

This aligns with the need for simplicity and broad ecosystem compatibility in the law-diagrams project. Additional support comes from explicit mentions of Mermaid being usable via multiple access points—such as a live editor and via API or dependencies—facilitating flexible integration into pipelines and LLMS-driven workflows. The documentation also notes Mermaid’s breadth of diagram types (flowcharts, Gantt charts, etc.), which is valuable for representing complex constitutional decision flows and related diagrams. The Mermaid homepage emphasizes ease of creation, which reinforces its suitability for quickly generating diagrams without heavy tooling overhead. A writerside documentation piece reinforces that Mermaid supports numerous diagram types, enhancing its versatility for varied diagramming needs in a legal-constitutional context. Mermaids’ availability in multiple formats (live editor, CLI for SVG rendering) adds practical deployment options for different stages of the workflow. A comparative resource discussing Mermaid versus PlantUML provides contextual justification for preferring Mermaid when considering simplicity and ecosystem fit for this use case. While layout engine discussions are tangential, they further corroborate the importance of choosing an approach with robust rendering behavior and tooling support. Taken together, these excerpts support the conclusion that Mermaid is the optimal primary recommendation for the core task of generating integrated documentation diagrams due to its simplicity, wide support, and proven effectiveness in similar projects.",

These excerpts corroborate the idea that Mermaid is the baseline option and that users can rely on text/code-based definitions to render diagrams, which aligns with the field’s emphasis on simplicity and Markdown-like definitions. Additional excerpts emphasize that Mermaid supports various diagram types and that there are live editors and documentation resources, which support the notion of Mermaid being a straightforward starting point for diagram creation. A few excerpts also discuss the broader Mermaid ecosystem, including its rendering in different environments and the availability of syntax references, which reinforces the trade-off discussion around ease-of-use versus interactivity when comparing to other libraries. Although the field value lists multiple other libraries with advanced features (Cytoscape.js, D3.js, d3-graphviz, React Flow with Elk.js, high-performance WebGL libraries), the provided excerpts predominantly cover Mermaid-related capabilities and documentation, so those other libraries are not as strongly evidenced within these excerpts.

Overall, the most relevant sources collectively illustrate that Markdown-like diagram definitions (as with Mermaid) tend to be more LLM-friendly and less verbose than formal grammars, aligning with the notion of medium friendliness for the DOT option as described in the field value.

In particular, content that introduces PlantUML and Mermaid and contrasts their capabilities provides context for selecting a diagramming approach. Additional content focused on Mermaid (its homepage, live editor, and usage patterns) informs how such tools render diagrams from text definitions, which is relevant when considering text-based DSLs for diagrams. Although the DOT language itself is not mentioned, these excerpts collectively illustrate a spectrum of open-source diagramming options and their workflows (definition language to rendering), which is the closest alignment to evaluating a DOT-like toolchain for graphs and cross-references. The Mermaid-focused items contribute to understanding the Markdown-like or DSL-based approach used to define diagrams, which can be conceptually related to graph specification languages like DOT, even if not identical. The layout-engine oriented entry broadens the context to how diagram layouts can vary across tools, which is useful when considering performance and readability for complex graphs. Overall, the strongest support comes from discussions that compare diagram tools and describe how to deploy and render diagrams from textual definitions, with Mermaid-based content offering practical implementation details that could map to DOT-like workflows. The remaining entries provide supplementary context about Mermaid capabilities and usage but do not directly mention DOT or Graphviz-specific features.",

Excerpts that explicitly describe Mermaid as a text-based tool that renders diagrams from a Markdown-like or scripting syntax demonstrate that it is a modern language for diagram creation, aligning with the description. In particular, passages stating that Mermaid uses a JavaScript-based, Markdown-inspired syntax to render diagrams show that it is designed as a text-to-diagram language. Additional excerpts describing Mermaid’s live editor and its ability to render various diagram types reinforce its role as a flexible, modern language for diagrams, including the notion of re-creating diagrams from textual definitions. Supplemental excerpts that discuss tooling around Mermaid (such as the command-line interface or online editors) further illustrate that Mermaid functions as a practical, modern diagramming language ecosystem suitable for high-quality diagrams and modular workflows. While some excerpts highlight related tools (e.g., PlantUML) for comparison, they do not contradict the core characterization of Mermaid as the modern text-to-diagram language described in the field value. Overall, the most supportive excerpts directly corroborate the idea that Mermaid is a contemporary, text-based diagram language with useful tooling and a Markdown-like syntax, which matches the field value’s emphasis on a modern text-to-diagram language with a focus on quality and usability.",

One excerpt notes that the models are trained to think for longer before responding, which directly matches the concept of deliberate reasoning and extended contemplation. Another excerpt emphasizes that the new models can integrate images into their chain of thought, indicating an expanded, multimodal reasoning process, which reinforces the idea of deeper, more capable reasoning. A separate excerpt states that these models have full access to tools via function calling, supporting the notion of enhanced reasoning aided by tooling and external capabilities. Additional language highlights that these are the smartest models released thus far and that their reasoning plus tool access yields stronger performance, which underpins the field value’s emphasis on superior reasoning benchmarks. A further excerpt explicitly labels the approach as multimodal, reinforcing the broader capability set that accompanies deeper reasoning. Less direct but still relevant are excerpts describing faster, high-throughput reasoning with core capabilities intact, and general claims about increased reasoning power and overall usefulness, which provide contextual support for the field value without mentioning deliberate reasoning as explicitly. Collectively, these excerpts build a coherent picture of an April-2025-era model family designed for deeper, longer, and more capable reasoning aided by tools and multimodal inputs, aligning with the requested finegrained field value while lacking explicit mention of the exact 200,000-token context window.",

For example, one excerpt describes o4-mini as a quicker, more compact relative of o3 intended for high-throughput applications, which helps establish that both variants are in consideration for a cost profile. Other excerpts announce the o3 and o4-mini models, highlighting that they are the latest in the o-series and emphasize capabilities such as longer think time, tool integration, and multimodal features, which contextualize why cost profiles would matter for these specific models. Although none of the excerpts provide explicit pricing figures, they collectively confirm that the cost profile should pertain to the same models named in these excerpts, namely o3 and o4-mini, and that any pricing details would be associated with these variants. Therefore, these excerpts are relevant as they establish the scope (which models) and the context (why pricing would differ by model) needed to interpret the stated cost values. The explicit pricing numbers in the field value cannot be directly verified from the excerpts, but the excerpts support the choice of models and the relevance of a cost comparison between them.",

DMN is easily readable by the different types of people involved in decision management. These include: business people who specify the rules and monitor their application; business analysts. DMN is designed to work alongside BPMN and/or CMMN, providing a mechanism to model the decision-making associated with processes and cases. While BPMN, CMMN and DMN can be used independently, they were carefully designed to be complementary. Indeed, many organizations require a combination of process models for their prescriptive workflows, case models for their reactive activities, and decision models for their more complex, multi-criteria business rules. Those organizations will benefit from using the three standards in combination, selecting which one is most appropriate to each type of activity modeling.

            "1. **Diagrams** : A Python library that lets you draw cloud system architectures in code. Designed for rapid prototyping, `Diagrams` eliminates the need for separate diagramming tools. It supports major providers and stacks like AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.",
            "2. **Go Diagrams** : It offers the same functionality as `Diagrams` , but lets you write in Go, providing a familiar environment for Go enthusiasts.",
            "3. **Mermaid** : A JavaScript library that enables creating diagrams and visualizations using text. It uses Markdown-style text definitions that feed into a renderer to create complex diagrams. With `Mermaid` , you can keep your documentation at pace with development, solving the problem of “doc-rot”.",
            "4. **PlantUML** : Offers a domain-specific language to generate a wide variety of diagram types. From sequence diagrams and architectural diagrams to network topology and Gantt charts, `PlantUML` can handle it all. It even supports ASCII art! While it has a bit of a learning curve compared to other tools, its broad features make `PlantUML` a flexible and powerful option for embedding diagrams alongside code.",
            "5. **ASCII Diagram Editors** : These tools allow you to draw diagrams visually or in text and then render them as ASCII art. These tools harness the power and simplicity of plain text, allowing you to easily author text-based diagrams, layouts, flow charts, and more. Some examples of this class of tools include web-based `asciiflow` and `Monodraw` , which is Mac only.",

            "Numbers in FEEL are based on the [IEEE 754-2008](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935/) Decimal 128 format, with 34 digits of precision. Internally, numbers are represented in Java as `BigDecimals` with `MathContext DECIMAL128` . FEEL supports only one number data type, so the same type is used to represent both integers and floating point numbers. FEEL numbers use a dot ( `.` ) as a decimal separator. FEEL does not support `-INF` , `+INF` , or `NaN` . FEEL uses `null` to represent invalid numbers. FEEL specification does not support a literal scientific notation. E.g., `1.2e3` is not valid FEEL syntax. You can use `1.2*10**3` instead. Drools extends the DMN specification and supports additional number notations:",
            "FEEL: supports the following data types:\n\n* Numbers\n* Strings\n* Boolean values\n* Dates\n* Time\n* Date and time\n* Days and time duration\n* Years and months duration\n* Functions\n* Contexts\n* Ranges (or intervals)\n* Lists",

            "* Three-valued logic ( `true` , `false` , `null` )",
            "FEEL has `context` literals that you can use to create contexts. A `context` in FEEL is a list of key and value pairs, similar to maps in languages like Java. In the example, the expression creates a context with two entries, `x` and `y` , representing a coordinate in a chart. In DMN 1.2, another way to create contexts is to create an item definition that contains the list of keys as attributes, and then declare the variable as having that item definition type. The Drools DMN API supports DMN `ItemDefinition` structural types in a `DMNContext` represented in two ways:"

For a given query (e.g., “show all force majeure clauses that mention ‘pandemic’”), the system does a vector search to find semantically similar clauses, then applies a keyword filter for “pandemic” to narrow results.

            "Document-Based Chunking [​]( \"Direct link to Document-Based Chunking\")\n\nDocument-based chunking uses the **intrinsic structure of a document** . Instead of relying on generic separators, it parses the document based on its format-specific elements. For example:\n\n* **Markdown** : Split by headings ( `#` , `##` ) to capture sections or subsections. * **HTML** : Split by tags ( `<p>` , `<div>` ) to preserve logical content blocks. * **PDF** : After preprocessing (e.g., OCR or conversion to Markdown), split by headers, paragraphs, tables, or other structural elements. * **Programming Code** : Split by functions or classes (e.g., `def` in Python) to maintain logical units of code. With this method, chunks stay aligned with the document’s logical organization, which often also correlates with semantic meaning as well.",
            "### Late Chunking [​]( \"Direct link to Late Chunking\")\n\n[Late chunking](/blog/late-chunking) is a slightly different type of technique that aims to solve a common problem in other chunking strategies: **context loss** . In other chunking techniques, when you split a document first and then create embeddings, each chunk becomes isolated. This can result in ambiguous or lost context within the chunk that was explained or referenced earlier in a document. Late chunking works backwards. Instead of splitting first, you start by feeding the entire document into a long-context embedding model. This creates detailed, token-level embeddings that understand the full picture. Only then do you split the document into chunks. When you create the embedding for each chunk, you use the token embeddings that were already created with full context. You simply average the relevant token embeddings for that chunk. This means every chunk retains context about the whole docum",

The idea is pretty straightforward: You create multiple layers of chunks at different levels of detail. * At the **top layer** , you create large chunks that summarize broad sections or themes, like the title and abstract. * At the **next layers** , you split those sections into progressively smaller chunks that capture finer details such as arguments, examples, or definitions. This lets your RAG system start with the high-level overview and then drill down into specifics when users need more detail.

            "## What should we think about when choosing a chunking strategy? Several variables play a role in determining the best chunking strategy, and these variables vary depending on the use case. Here are some key aspects to keep in mind:\n\n1. **What kind of data is being chunked? ** Are you working with long documents, such as articles or books, or shorter content, like tweets, product descriptions, or chat messages? Small documents may not need to be chunked at all, while larger ones may exhibit certain structure that will inform chunking strategy, such as sub-headers or chapters. 2. **Which embedding model are you using? ** Different embedding models have differing capacities for information, especially on specialized domains like code, finance, medical, or legal information. And, the way these models are trained can strongly affect how they perform in practice. After choosing an appropriate model for your domain, be sure to adapt your chunking strategy to align with expected document types the model has been trained on. 3. **What are your expectations for the length and complexity of user queries? ** Will they be short and specific or long and complex? This may inform the way you choose to chunk your content as well so that there’s a closer correlation between the embedded query and embedded chunks. 4. **How will the retrieved results be utilized within your specific application?\n ... \nThis can result in a more comprehensive vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text. Larger input text sizes, on the other hand, may introduce noise or dilute the significance of individual sentences or phrases, making finding precise matches when querying the index more difficult. These chunks help support use cases such as question-answering, where answers may be a few paragraphs or more. Many modern AI applications work with longer documents, which almost always require chunking. ## Chunking methods\n\n### Fixed-size chunking\n\nThis is the most common and straightforward approach to chunking: we simply decide the number of tokens in our chunk, and use this number to break up our documents into fixed size chunks. Usually, this number is the max context window size of the embedding model (such as 1024 for llama-text-embed-v2, or 8196 for text-embedding-3-small). Keep in mind that different embedding models may tokenize text differently, so you will need to estimate token counts accurately. Fixed-sized chunking will be the best path in most cases, and we recommend starting here and iterating only after determining it insufficient. ### “Content-aware” Chunking\n\nAlthough fixed-size chunking is quite easy to implement, it can ignore critical structure within documents that can be used to inform relevant chunks. Content-aware chunking refers to strategies that adhere to structure to help inform the meaning of our chunks.\n ... \nThis is a great middle ground between always splitting on a specific character and using a more semantic splitter, while also ensuring fixed chunk sizes when possible. ### Document structure-based chunking\n\nWhen chunking large documents such as PDFs, DOCX, HTML, code snippets, Markdown files and LaTex, specialized chunking methods can help preserve the original structure of the content during chunk creation. * PDF documents contain loads of headers, text, tables, and other bits and pieces that require preprocessing to chunk. LangChain has some handy utilities to help process these documents, while Pinecone Assistant can [chunk and processes these for you](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/files-overview)\n* HTML, from scraped web pages can contain tags (<p> for paragraphs, or <title> for titles) that can inform text to be broken up or identified, like on product pages or blog posts. Roll your own parser, or use [LangChain splitters here to process these for chunking](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/split_html/)\n* [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) : Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. By recognizing the Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, lists, and code blocks), you can intelligently divide the content based on its structure and hierarchy, resulting in more semantically coherent chunks.\n* [**LaTex**](https://www.latex-project.org/) : LaTeX is a document preparation system and markup language often used for academic papers and technical documents. By parsing the LaTeX commands and environments, you can create chunks that respect the logical organization of the content (e.g., sections, subsections, and equations), leading to more accurate and contextually relevant results. ### Semantic Chunking\n\nA new experimental technique for approaching chunking was first introduced by [Greg Kamradt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregkamradt/) . [In his notebook](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/main/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb) , Kamradt rightfully points to the fact that a global chunking size may be too trivial of a mechanism to take into account the **meaning** of segments within the document. If we use this type of mechanism, we can’t know if we’re combining segments that have anything to do with one another. Luckily, if you’re building an application with LLMs, you most likely already have the ability to create **embeddings -** and embeddings can be used to extract the semantic meaning present in your data. This semantic analysis can be used to create chunks that are made up of sentences that talk about the same theme or topic. Semantic chunking involves breaking a document into sentences, grouping each sentence with its surrounding sentences, and generating embeddings for these grou"

            "Prompt engineering is a subfield within artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction (HCI) focused on the design, analysis, and optimization of prompts, structured inputs or queries, to elicit desired responses or behaviours from AI systems, particularly those based on LLMs. This domain encompasses a range of activities, including the formulation of prompts to guide AI in legal terms extraction, thereby enhancing its performance.",
            "This study investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a transformative solution for the extraction of legal terms, presenting a novel approach to overcome the constraints associated with the need for extensive annotated datasets.",
            "The most effective approach identified in our study involves prompt engineering, incorporating examples directly within the prompts, particularly when applied to the largest LLM, GPT-4.",
            "Large Language Models (LLMs) now present a compelling alternative through zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities, effectively addressing the challenge of dependency on large volumes of annotated data for specific task training.",
            "GPT-4 with one-shot prompt, delivered superior performance, achieving a precision of approximately 0.676, a recall of about 0.704, and an F1 score around 0.690. Notably, GPT-4 was able to identify new terms not previously annotated in the evaluation dataset by experts.",
            "To address and potentially overcome these limitations, we plan to investigate the prospects of system hybridization, combining the strengths of LLMs with those of previous technologies, such as rule-based systems and deep learning methods.",

            "The model appeared overly constrained, limiting its ability to extract legal terms. As a result, we determined that allowing a certain degree of creativity was necessary, which informed our decision to use the current temperature setting of 0.5.",
            "In conclusion, LLMs exhibit considerable potential for conducting information extraction within the legal domain, even when operating with zero prior knowledge input.",
            "We evaluated and compared, to a rule-based and BERT systems, the performance of four LLMs: GPT-4, Miqu-1-70b, Mixtral-8x7b, and Mistral-7b, within the scope of limited annotated data availability.",

This is necessary in order to provide integrated and self-contained representations of legal  \nresources that can be made available on the Web as XML representations [32] and so foster  \nSemantic Web technologies such as: NLP, Information Retrieval and Extraction (IR/IE), graphical  \nrepresentation, as well as Web ontologies and rules. 2 To provide an expressive XML standard for modeling normative rules that satisfies legal domain\n\nrequirements.

This indicates there is an established baseline for future maintenance and-release planning.\n- Other excerpts describe the project’s repository layout and key components (RAWDATA as the source text, .zzRef as the original PDFs, Mermaid01 as the diagram suite, and MermaidTasks for task tracking). This shows the structural channels through which updates propagate: updating the RAWDATA text, regenerating Mermaid diagrams via Mermaid tooling, and tracking progress through a dedicated task log.\n- There is an explicit reference to an amendment timeline and amendment compliance up to the 106th Amendment, which demonstrates a governance and versioning orientation, i.e., tracking changes over time and ensuring diagrams reflect current legal text. This aligns with a maintenance strategy that emphasizes currency and traceability of changes.\n- The Mermaids Tasks and PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY artifacts illustrate a documented methodology for updating diagrams and their associated text when amendments occur, including versioned outputs (M01 through M39) and an explicit archive-oriented approach.

The SOP entry outlines a structured approach for constitution analysis and Mermaid diagram creation, including how tasks are organized, the file segmentation process, and the workflow for diagram generation. This aligns with the idea of a maintenance/update pipeline that orchestrates how amendments trigger downstream diagram updates. The adjacent excerpt reinforces this by enumerating an explicit Reading and Analysis Process and criteria for Mermaid diagram layout, which supports the concept of a repeatable pipeline that takes updated inputs and produces updated visual outputs. A closely related entry details the use of Mermaid Diagram Creation in the SOP, underscoring a planned, rule-based approach to generating diagrams from extracted text, which is central to an automated pipeline that reacts to new amendments. Together these two excerpts establish the pipeline’s existence and its organizational backbone, i.e., diff analysis and automated regeneration are plausible components given the described procedures and tooling.\n\nOther excerpts focus on automated validation and testing of diagrams. The Mermaid Validation Script and Procedures text describes concrete steps for validating Mermaid diagrams, including syntax checks and structure verification. This supports the field value’s fourth-stage requirement, i.e., automated regression testing and syntactic validation of updated diagrams. The text about a validation workflow also mentions specific checks (graph declarations, subgraphs, and proper node syntax), which map well to a CI/CD style validation gate that would run after an update. In addition, a set of excerpts explicitly discusses troubleshooting and best practices for mermaid diagrams, which is relevant background for maintaining an automated pipeline that regenerates and verifies outputs under new amendments.\n\nCollectively, these excerpts map to key stages of the described update_pipeline: (1) Diff analysis to identify changes in the constitution text, (2) Impact/mappng of changes to Mermaid diagrams, (3) Automated regeneration of diagrams via mermaid-cli or equivalent tooling, (4) Syntactic and visual regression testing to ensure diagrams render correctly after updates, and (5) Ongoing SOPs that codify stepwise, repeatable processes. The combination of SOP-level guidance for diagram creation and concrete validation/scripts for Mermaid diagrams provides strong direct support for an automated maintenance pipeline that handles amendments and diagram updates.",

      "reasoning": "The user wants a structured plan for monitoring official sources to keep diagrams updated. The most direct support for this field value comes from excerpts that explicitly name or point to the official sources and amendment publication channels. Passages that reference the Gazette of India (egazette.gov.in) show the official gazette publication channel. Passages that reference the Legislative Department (legislative.gov.in) point to the primary source for constitutional text and amendment bills. Passages that mention IndiaCode (indiacode.nic.in) and PRS Legislative Research (prsindia.org) provide corroborating channels used for consolidated or analytical governance information. In particular: excerpts that state “Website of Gazette of India” and describe egazette as the official gazette publishing Acts and amendments; excerpts that refer to “AMENDMENT ACTS | Legislative Department, India” and to the Legislative Department portal; excerpts that reference the Constitution Amendment Acts and the hosting/archival portals (Legislative Department, Gazette, IndiaCode). Additionally, passages that mention “The Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act, 2023” and the portal where such acts are published (Gazette) help tie the monitoring activity to concrete artifacts and their official publication venues. The cited excerpts collectively establish a mapping to the four target sources and illustrate how amendments and final texts are disseminated, forming a solid basis for the proposed field value. The confidence is high because there are multiple, explicit references to these official sources and their publication channels across several excerpts, providing concrete basis for building a monitoring strategy. The ordering from most to least relevant prioritizes excerpts that name or describe the official sources themselves (Gazette, Legislative Department, IndiaCode, PRS), then excerpts that discuss amendment acts and their portal publication, and finally passages that merely discuss related constitutional content without naming sources.",

Specifically, the excerpt stating the Naming Convention reinforces the practice of immutable, versioned diagram files that map to successive versions, which is essential for a robust archival strategy. The Storage Location excerpt confirms where archived or historical outputs are kept, enabling users to retrieve earlier states. The subsequent excerpts in the same block further cement the archival approach by detailing the project’s archival/readiness posture around versioning, amendment coverage, and historical snapshots (e.g., amendment compliance up through the 106th Amendment). Together, these excerpts provide a cohesive view of a deliberate versioning, tagging, changelog, and archival strategy, including how versions correspond to amendments and how older states can be accessed or viewed later. While there are many entries about overall project status and completion, the highlighted items specifically document the procedural backbone for archiving and version-tracking (tags, changelogs, archive views) that the field value describes.",
