## Analytical Framework Documentation

### Superintelligence Methodology Applied
- **Phase 0 - Meta-Cognitive Tuning**: Deconstruct content for Rust library opportunities
- **Phase 1 - Cognitive Staging**: Activate expert personas (Rust Expert, Product Strategist, Market Analyst, Implementation Specialist, Skeptical Engineer)
- **Phase 2 - Multi-Perspective Exploration**: Generate conventional approaches, create 3+ conceptual blends, simulate structured debate
- **Phase 3 - Verification & Refinement**: Generate fact-checkable questions, validate claims, correct inconsistencies

### Expert Council Composition
1. **Rust Domain Expert**: Deep technical knowledge of Rust ecosystem and performance characteristics
2. **Product Market Strategist**: Business positioning, market sizing, and competitive analysis  
3. **Implementation Architect**: Technical feasibility, complexity assessment, and development effort estimation
4. **Developer Experience Specialist**: API design, ergonomics, and adoption pathway analysis
5. **Skeptical Engineer**: Challenge assumptions, identify risks, and validate claims (MANDATORY)

### Quality Assurance Standards
- **Uniqueness Validation**: Each library idea checked against existing catalog entries
- **PMF Scoring**: Complete 23-metric evaluation with supporting rationale
- **Source Traceability**: All insights linked to originating content chunks
- **Progress Verification**: Regular folder analysis script validation
