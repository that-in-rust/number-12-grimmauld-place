# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic analytical framework for extracting high Product Market Fit (PMF) Rust library ideas from the Ideas001/RAWContent01 content repository. The system will methodically process 137,000+ lines across 62 files using 1000-line chunks with 300-line overlaps, apply the enhanced PMF evaluation framework with Shreyas Doshi strategic analysis, and maintain a single consolidated catalog with uniqueness validation and progress tracking.

### Analytical Processing Pipeline

The system follows a five-phase analytical pipeline:

1. **Content Segmentation & Overlap Management**: Break down files into 1000-line chunks with 300-line overlaps
2. **Superintelligence Analysis**: Apply IQ 1000 framework with expert council activation
3. **Library Extraction & PMF Evaluation**: Extract unique ideas and apply 23-metric scoring
4. **Consolidation & Uniqueness Validation**: Maintain single master catalog with duplicate prevention
5. **Progress Validation & Version Control**: Track progress with scripts and git commits

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Content Processing and Chunking System

**Purpose**: Systematically process all 62 files with optimal chunk sizing and overlap management

**Processing Strategy**:
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 lines per analytical unit for optimal cognitive processing
- **Overlap Size**: 300 lines between chunks to prevent boundary insight loss
- **File Sequencing**: Process files in logical order based on content relevance and size
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain narrative continuity across chunk boundaries

**Chunk Management Process**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[File Start] --> B[Lines 1-1000<br/>Chunk 1]
    B --> C[Lines 701-1700<br/>Chunk 2<br/>300-line overlap]
    C --> D[Lines 1401-2400<br/>Chunk 3<br/>300-line overlap]
    D --> E[Continue Pattern...]
    
    style B fill:#e3f2fd
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#e3f2fd
```

**Deliverables**:
- Chunk inventory with source file mapping and line ranges

    B --> C{Exact Match Found?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Enhance Existing Entry]
    C -->|No| E{Similar Concept Found?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Evaluate for Merge vs Separate]
    E -->|No| G[Add as New Unique Entry]
    F --> H{Merge Decision}
    H -->|Merge| I[Consolidate into Enhanced Entry]
    H -->|Separate| J[Add as Related but Distinct]
    D --> K[Update Master Catalog]
    G --> K
    I --> K
    J --> K
    
    style C fill:#ffecb3
    style E fill:#ffecb3
    style H fill:#ffecb3
    style K fill:#e8f5e8
```
